# Conan (2.x) recipe for ac3forge - installs the library only (ac3::forge,
# plus matroska::matroska, mp4::mp4 and mpegts::mpegts behind their own
# default-on options), never the CLI, GUI, tests, examples or fuzz
# harnesses. Same scope as the vcpkg port (packaging/vcpkg-port/ac3forge/) -
# one Conan option <-> one AC3FORGE_BUILD_<NAME> CMake option, same pattern
# that port's vcpkg_check_features() call already establishes. ac3adm::ac3adm
# (the ADM/BW64 reader) is deliberately NOT an option here for the same
# reason it has no vcpkg feature - it isn't part of the find_package(ac3forge)
# package at all, so there's nothing for a Conan option to install.
#
# This recipe wraps cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake's own install()/export()
# rules rather than reimplementing them: package() just runs `cmake --install`
# and package_info() points consumers at the CMake package config ac3forge
# already generates (ac3forgeConfig.cmake et al.), instead of asking Conan's
# CMakeDeps generator to synthesise a second, competing one - see
# package_info()'s comment below.
#
# Staged here (packaging/conan/) for local `conan create` validation before
# being submitted to ConanCenter (conan-center-index) as a recipe there -
# see docs/releasing.md.
