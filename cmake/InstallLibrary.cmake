# install() rules + package config for distributing ac3::forge, matroska::matroska and mp4::mp4
# independently, consumable via find_package(ac3forge). ac3::audio (src/audio/) is deliberately
# NOT installed/exported here - it is a CLI/GUI implementation detail, not part of the
# distributed package; see docs/library/index.md.
#
# include()'d from the root CMakeLists.txt after add_subdirectory(src/forge) and, for each
# optional component, its own guarded add_subdirectory(src/matroska|mp4|mpegts), before
# include(Packaging) - CPack's own library component (cmake/Packaging.cmake) packages exactly
# what gets install()'d here.
#
# matroska::matroska, mp4::mp4 and mpegts::mpegts are all optional components, off-able via
# their own AC3FORGE_BUILD_MATROSKA/AC3FORGE_BUILD_MP4/AC3FORGE_BUILD_MPEGTS option (root
# CMakeLists.txt) - each its own AC3FORGE_BUILD_<NAME> option, its own guarded
# add_subdirectory(), and its own guarded block below. Each maps 1:1 onto its own vcpkg
# feature (packaging/vcpkg-port/ac3forge/vcpkg.json's "matroska"/"mp4"/"mpegts", wired
# through portfile.cmake's vcpkg_check_features()), so a vcpkg install only gets the ones its
# feature selection actually asked for.
#
# Every install() rule below carries COMPONENT library: without one, CPack
# files it under its own "Unspecified" component, inconsistent once
# component-based packaging is on (see cmake/Packaging.cmake) - same reason
# apps/cli/CMakeLists.txt's ac3cli install() carries COMPONENT runtime.
#
# The LIBRARY DESTINATION rules below additionally carry NAMELINK_COMPONENT
# library, splitting them from COMPONENT libruntime. On Unix, a versioned
# shared library install produces two files - the real
# libac3forge.so.<version> and an unversioned libac3forge.so symlink (the
# "namelink") a linker resolves -l against - and NAMELINK_COMPONENT is CMake's
# own mechanism for filing those two files under different CPack components:
# COMPONENT names the real .so, NAMELINK_COMPONENT names the symlink. Confirmed
# empirically (see cmake/Packaging.cmake's DEB/RPM comment) that today's
# monolithic .deb bundles ac3cli together with the full SDK - headers, static
# archives, CMake package config, .so and symlink alike - because CPack's DEB/
# RPM generators ignore CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL entirely unless *_COMPONENT_INSTALL
# is explicitly turned on for them. This split is what makes a real
# runtime/-dev separation possible there: libruntime becomes a small
# "just the .so a linked binary needs at runtime" package, while library
# keeps everything only a builder needs (headers, static archives, CMake
# config, and the symlink you link against, -l style). RUNTIME/ARCHIVE (the
# Windows .dll/.lib pair, and the static archives on every platform) stay
# under COMPONENT library throughout: NAMELINK_COMPONENT only ever affects the
# LIBRARY DESTINATION install, i.e. Unix .so installs - Windows has no
# namelink concept at all, so this is a no-op there and the Windows dev ZIP is
# unaffected.

# OFF is what a vcpkg port needs: vcpkg's per-triplet linkage policy (and its post-build lint)

# matroska::matroska_shared. Both still land in the one ac3forgeConfig.cmake
# a consumer's find_package(ac3forge) resolves - see ac3forgeConfig.cmake.in,

# it's the one mandatory, always-built component, but it still gets named
# after its own component identity ("forge", matching its raw target names
# forge_static/forge_shared) rather than after the overall package, for the
