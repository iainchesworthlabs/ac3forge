# CPack packaging. Included once, from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, after
# every target's install() rules have been declared.
#
# A plain ZIP archive is always offered (needs no external tool). Platform-
# native formats are layered on top when the packaging tool for that format is
# actually available, so `cpack` degrades gracefully instead of failing
# outright. Which targets end up in a package is decided entirely by which
# install() rules ran - ac3cli's runs unconditionally (AC3FORGE_BUILD_CLI
# defaults ON), ac3gui's only when AC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI is ON - so no extra
# gating is needed here for that.
#
# CMakePresets.json's packagePresets deliberately carry no "generators"
# field: `cpack --preset` passes that field to cpack as -G on the command
# line, which OVERRIDES the CPACK_GENERATOR list computed below - confirmed
# empirically, a preset naming NSIS made cpack hard-fail with "Cannot find
# NSIS compiler makensis" even with the find_program() gate below correctly
# leaving NSIS out of CPACK_GENERATOR because makensis was not on PATH.
# Omitting it lets CPack fall back to CPACK_GENERATOR from here instead, so
# the graceful degradation this file computes actually takes effect through
# `cpack --preset` and not only through a bare `cpack` invocation.

# Library component(s): a second, separate download alongside the existing

# for a third party consuming ac3::forge/matroska::matroska via
# find_package(ac3forge) (see cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake). Everything
# install()'d without an explicit COMPONENT falls into CPack's own
# "Unspecified" component, which is why ac3cli/ac3gui and every
# InstallLibrary.cmake rule now carry one explicitly.
#
# Three components, not two: "runtime" (ac3cli/ac3gui, unchanged), "library"
# (headers, static archives, CMake package config, and - on Unix - the
# unversioned .so namelink symlink you link against), and "libruntime" (just
# the versioned .so/.dylib a linked binary loads at runtime - see
# cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake's NAMELINK_COMPONENT comment for why that file
# alone is split out). library+libruntime are DELIBERATELY kept as one
# archive download below (a "-dev" ZIP/TGZ downloader wants both without
# knowing this split exists) but as three separate DEB/RPM packages
# (cmake/CPackProjectConfig.cmake overrides the grouping back to IGNORE for
# just those two generators) - that split is the entire point of shipping
# them as .deb/.rpm at all: apt/dnf can then pull in "the .so a linked binary
# needs" via libac3forge0 without the headers/static archives libac3forge-dev
# carries, the same libFOO/libFOO-dev shape every other Linux C library uses.
#
# CPACK_ARCHIVE_COMPONENT_INSTALL is specifically the Archive generator
# family's (ZIP/TGZ) own component-install switch - it does not affect
# NSIS/DragNDrop, each of which has its own separate
# CPACK_<GENERATOR>_COMPONENT_INSTALL flag, left off here deliberately:
#   - NSIS: a component installer can't also produce a second standalone
#     download the way a second archive naturally can - splitting it would
#     need an entirely different NSIS packaging shape, not a flag flip.
#   - DragNDrop: no macOS host to build or verify this against at all (see
#     the DragNDrop branch above); cmake/CPackProjectConfig.cmake already
#     forces it monolithic regardless of the component/grouping state here.
# DEB/RPM get their own *_COMPONENT_INSTALL switch, set inside their own
# find_program() blocks above, now that the split is real work rather than
# a placeholder.
# The `runtime` component is ac3cli/ac3gui plus, since roadmap IO8, the
# generated ac3cli.1 man page and the bash/zsh/fish/PowerShell completion
# scripts - all install()'d with COMPONENT runtime from
# apps/cli/CMakeLists.txt, so every generator below picks them up with the
# binary rather than needing a component of their own. They are absent from a
# CROSS build's packages by construction: they are produced by running the
# freshly built ac3cli, which a cross build cannot do (see that file's own
