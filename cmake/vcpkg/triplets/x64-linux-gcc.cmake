# Chainload policy: VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is set once, per concrete
# configure preset, and is deliberately NOT repeated here - one place decides
# which compiler a preset uses.
#
# So vcpkg builds Catch2 with its own default compiler rather than the pinned
# gcc-15. That is safe for this project because both the GCC and the Clang
# toolchain link the system libstdc++, so the port and the project agree on the
# standard-library ABI. Should iclforge ever take a port whose ABI is sensitive
# to the exact compiler, that assumption is what has to be revisited.
