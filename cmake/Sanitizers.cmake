#
# ICLFORGE_SANITIZERS is a comma-separated -fsanitize= value (e.g.
# "address,undefined") applied to every target via global compile and link
# flags. Empty (the default) compiles nothing differently. Clang/GCC only -
# MSVC's /fsanitize=address has no UBSan equivalent, so a sanitizer build
# belongs on the Linux presets (see CMakePresets.json's *-asan-ubsan legs),
# not bolted onto the MSVC ones.
#
# -fno-sanitize-recover=all is deliberate: a sanitizer build exists to fail
# the build/test run on the first violation, not to log and keep going. A
# continue-on-violation run defeats the point of a CI gate.
