# Validation

Quality is measured, not asserted, and coverage has known edges. This page is both: how output
is checked, and exactly where checking runs out.

## Five independent checks

In rough order of strength:

1. **The in-repo decoder.** Fully normative and shares the encoder's core, so a round trip
   exercises the bit-allocation model in both directions. It reaches float32-precision PCM
   parity with FFmpeg's decoder on identical streams: max sample difference 7.9e-6 (≈ −102 dBFS)
   for AC-3, 1.4e-5 for E-AC-3. It also reads FFmpeg's own encoder output.
2. **FFmpeg as an external oracle.** Every stream this project produces is strict-decoded with
   `-xerror -err_detect crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode`, which fails on a CRC error, a
   bitstream violation or a buffer problem rather than concealing it. Automated and required in
   CI.
3. **Independent Python transcriptions.** `tools/` holds second implementations of the spec
   pseudocode, written from the standard separately from the C++: the §7.2.2 bit allocation, the
   Tables 7.29/7.30 DRC lookups, MDCT goldens. Agreement between two transcriptions of the same
   text is weaker evidence than a decoder, but it catches transcription slips that a
   self-consistent round trip cannot.
4. **Dolby's own tooling as a syntax oracle.** The Reference Player and the Dolby Media Encoder
   were diffed field-for-field against this encoder's output during the object work. That found
   several real bugs — the EMDF container belonging in a skip field rather than the aux field,
   `codecdatae=0`, a dynamic-object-only programme with the LFE as an object but not a JOC
   output, and metadata flag arrays transmitted index-0-first.
5. **Fuzzing, in both directions.** Into the decoder: the libFuzzer harnesses under `fuzz/` drive
   the codec's untrusted-input entry points looking for crashes and undefined behaviour
   (ASan+UBSan), and two differential harnesses decode each mutated stream with both this
   project's decoder and FFmpeg's and diff the PCM. CI runs both: the `Fuzz Regress` job replays
   the checked-in seed and regression corpora on every push and PR, and the `Fuzz Differential`
   job adds a bounded mutation budget on pushes.

   Out of the encoder: `tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py` (AC-3) and
   `tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py` (E-AC-3, roadmap VX1) draw random legal encoder
   configurations crossed with adversarial PCM — transients, silence↔loud transitions inside one
   frame, spectral jumps between blocks, dense harmonics, clipping — and hold every stream they
   produce against both decoders. This is the one check here that varies the *input material*
   rather than the option list; it exists because an encoder defect that produced streams both
   decoders reject needed a specific input shape to reach, and so escaped every other check on
   this page. The E-AC-3 half additionally covers the Annex E tool tokens, the `fscod2` half
   rates, VBR, the layouts that need dependent substreams and Atmos object counts, and classifies
   each case by which oracle can actually read it (the table below). Bounded on every pull
   request, deeper nightly. See
   [fuzz/README.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/fuzz/README.md).

Contributor-facing detail on which oracle to reach for and how — including the exact FFmpeg
flags and the CI jobs that run them — is in [Oracles](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#oracles).

## Quality

`tools/ci/quality_race.py` synthesizes stereo programme material, encodes it with both ac3forge
and FFmpeg at matched bit rates, decodes both with FFmpeg as a neutral referee, aligns by
cross-correlation, and reports SNR against the original:

| Bit rate | ac3forge | FFmpeg | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 192 kbps | 41.23 dB | 40.98 dB | +0.25 |
| 256 kbps | 44.00 dB | 42.85 dB | +1.15 |
| 320 kbps | 45.09 dB | 44.15 dB | +0.94 |
| 448 kbps | 51.05 dB | 47.60 dB | +3.46 |

Measured with FFmpeg 8.0.1 on 2026-08-09; reproduce with `python tools/ci/quality_race.py ac3`.
SNR on synthetic material is a narrow metric — it says the waveform is closer, not that it
sounds better, and no *subjective* listening test has been run. `quality_race.py`'s tables (and
[Tool comparison trend](tool-comparison-trend.md)/[Landscape](landscape.md)) also carry an
objective perceptual-quality prediction alongside SNR, [ViSQOL](https://github.com/google/visqol)'s
MOS-LQO — narrower than a real listening panel, but closer to "how it would sound" than a
waveform-distance number, and something SNR alone cannot claim. It's an optional column
(`visqol-python` not installed shows `-`, never a failure), so it isn't in the snapshot table
above; see `perceptual_score()` in `tools/ci/quality_race.py`.

That is a one-off snapshot. [Quality trend](quality-trend.md) tracks the same gold-reference SNR
by commit, on every push to `develop` and `main`, so a regression shows up as a trend line
rather than only in that run's CI log.

## Performance and reference modes

Both transform hot spots — the forward MDCT (§8.2.3.2) and the inverse transform's step-3
complex sum (§7.9.4) — exist in two evaluations: the spec's own direct form, and a fast path
through a shared FFT kernel. The direct forms are the *reference*: they are what the standard
states, and every fast path is validated against its direct counterpart by the test suite (max
peak-normalized relative error 1.3e-13 forward, 7.8e-14 inverse, 1.7e-15 for `dft512`
against its own O(N²) summation; end-to-end agreement 331 dB direct-vs-fast for encode, and
232.1 dB (AC-3) / 208.2 dB (E-AC-3, every Annex E tool) / 217.9 dB (E-AC-3, enhanced coupling)
for a decode over 180 seconds of real material). The fast paths are the default, because that
evidence was reviewed and accepted before each default flipped.

The kernel itself is radix-4 with a trailing radix-2 stage where log2(P) is odd, specialised at
compile time for the three sizes the codec uses (P = 64, 128, 512), with the first stage's
unit twiddles eliminated and the digit-reversal permutation folded into each caller's own
input-producing loop rather than run as a pass — 1.6–1.75× the throughput of the generic
radix-2 core it replaced, at the same tolerances.

`ac3cli` exposes the pair as one intent-level switch: `mode=reference` runs every transform in
the command on the direct evaluations — for regenerating fixtures, comparing sample-for-sample
against an external decoder, or isolating a suspected transform defect — and `mode=performance`
(the default state) names the fast paths. The per-transform escape hatches `fast-mdct=off` and
`fast-imdct=off` adjust one half at a time; see
[Options & grammars](cli/metadata-options.md#command-specific-notes) for the full token
semantics. At the library level the same pair is `EncoderConfig::fast_mdct` /
`eac3::FrameConfig::fast_mdct` and `DecoderConfig::fast_imdct`.

Encoded output never depends on the decode-side switch. An enhanced-coupling encode does run an
inverse transform of its own — `ecpl_channel_spectrum` reconstructs the spectrum the decoder
will hold — and that one follows `eac3::FrameConfig::fast_mdct`, which makes that field the
encoder's fast-transform switch in both directions and keeps `mode=reference` direct end to
end. It is byte-identical either way on the encode corpus at the tolerances above, so it is a
speed choice, not an output one; `DecoderConfig::fast_imdct` reaches no encoder at all.

## Test suite

The Catch2 suites (`ac3tests` plus the `ac3perf` throughput suite) plus one `ctest` entry per
example program, run per platform. The GUI's Qt Quick Test harness (`ac3gui_qmltests`) adds one
entry on a GUI-enabled build, and the ALSA backend's `tests/backend/alsa/` adds 14 on a Linux
build with libasound present; `ctest` runs whatever the configuration registered:

```bash
ctest --preset test-windows-msvc-debug
```

## Where the oracles don't reach

FFmpeg and the in-repo decoder are complementary, not redundant, and neither covers everything
alone. FFmpeg reads Annex E coupling, spectral extension and AHT (98+ dB SNR for coupling and
spectral extension; 62–89 dB for AHT, which genuinely recodes mantissas rather than scaling or
synthesizing around already-decoded content, so a wider margin from bit-exact is expected there)
— but it refuses a *second* dependent substream (`ff_ac3_parse_header` rejects
`substreamid != 0`), which is exactly what 7.1.4 needs. The in-repo decoder reads every Annex E
tool combination at every layout, 7.1.4 included, so it backstops FFmpeg's one gap — but a stream
only the in-repo decoder can read is checked against itself, not against anything external.

| Stream | FFmpeg | In-repo decoder |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3, any supported mode | yes | yes |
| E-AC-3 up to 5.1.4 (one dependent), no Annex E tools | yes | yes |
| E-AC-3 7.1.4 (two dependents) | no | yes |
| E-AC-3 with cpl / spx / aht | yes | yes |
| E-AC-3 7.1.4 with Annex E tools | no | yes |
| E-AC-3 with enhanced coupling (`ecpl`) or transient pre-noise processing (`tpn`) | no | yes |
| E-AC-3 `fscod2` half rates (24/22.05/16 kHz) | header only | yes |

Every "no" in that column is a cell where a generated stream has to be checked some other way,
which is what [`tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py)
(roadmap VX1) is built around: it classifies every case it draws by which of these rows it lands
on, and checks the *framing* of the ones FFmpeg cannot decode — which needs no decode at all. Two
things do it: a walk over the four fields that fix E-AC-3's framing (syncword, `strmtyp`,
`substreamid`, `frmsiz`, all at fixed bit offsets), which shares nothing with the encoder and
works at every layout; and `ffprobe`'s own syncframe walk, where FFmpeg can be trusted to do one.
It is not asked about a two-dependent layout, because it demonstrably cannot: on one 7.1.4 stream
it reported 19 access units where 18 were written, splitting one at an offset that is not a
syncframe boundary — it had lost sync inside the very substream this table's "no" row is about.

None of this closes the gap — the paragraphs below still stand, and a misreading shared by this
project's encoder and its decoder would survive a framing check as easily as it survives the
round trip — but it is more than nothing, and it is where a bit-offset defect shows up first: a
syncframe written at the wrong offset is a syncframe whose `frmsiz` no longer lands the next
syncword where it promised. The harness's `--check-oracles` re-measures this table's own claims
against the installed FFmpeg, so a row that stops being true is reported rather than quietly
assumed.

**7.1.4 has no external oracle at all.** For that one layout, encoder and decoder are checked
against each other and nothing else:

```
$ ac3cli eac3-sine out.ec3 1 384 1000 50 714
$ ffmpeg -v error -i out.ec3 -f null -
[dec:eac3] Error submitting packet to decoder: Error number -84085770 occurred
$ ac3cli decode out.ec3 out.wav
decoded 32 E-AC-3 access units (3 substreams each) -> out.wav
  12 channels, 48000 Hz: L R C LFE Lrs Rrs Ls Rs Vhl Vhr Lts Rts
```

Fourteen channels are coded and twelve are rendered: per §E3.8.2 the dependent's Ls and Rs
replace the bed's rather than adding to them.

**Enhanced coupling and transient pre-noise processing have no external oracle at all — not even
the partial one 7.1.4 gets.** FFmpeg's own Annex E parser was never written to read either
tool's syntax, so it doesn't reject these streams the way it does a second dependent substream —
it has no model of the bits at all, which makes `-xerror` unusable as a check here rather than
merely unavailable. `tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s CI gate (`decode_scores_ours`) scores both through
this project's own decoder instead, the same self-consistency posture 7.1.4 falls back to, with
one weaker guarantee than 7.1.4 has: a defect both the encoder and decoder agree on — a
misreading of the spec shared by both sides rather than a one-sided bug — would not be caught by
either the CI gate or the round-trip unit tests in `tests/decoder/test_eac3_decoder.cpp`.

**`fscod2` audio content has no external decode oracle at all — not even Dolby's own.**
`ffprobe` walks every syncframe of a reduced-rate stream correctly (frame count, exact byte size,
exact spacing, and `sample_rate` all confirmed against all three rates), so the framing and
header are cross-checked externally. But actually decoding the audio is refused by both
real-world implementations available here: FFmpeg's E-AC-3 decoder (`Not yet implemented in
FFmpeg, patches welcome`) and, more surprisingly, Dolby's own Reference Player — `dlbac3parse`
reports `No valid frames found before end of stream` on a stream `ffprobe` reads frame-by-frame
without complaint, using the same pipeline (`tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s `dolby_decode`) that decodes
a normal-rate stream from this encoder without issue. `fscod2` appears to be a coding tool whose
own reference implementation does not support it. So the coded audio is verified only by this
project's own encoder/decoder round trip and the independent Python parser
(`tools/references/eac3_parse.py`).

**`compr` in E-AC-3 has no external oracle.** FFmpeg's Annex E header parser reads `compre` and
then skips the word, so `-heavy_compr` changes nothing on an E-AC-3 stream however good the
metadata is. It is covered bit-by-bit instead
([tests/meta/test_drc.cpp](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/tests/meta/test_drc.cpp),
[tools/references/eac3_parse.py](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/tools/references/eac3_parse.py)).

## What's confirmed against real hardware, and what isn't

The codec itself is platform-independent; only capture, monitor playback and IEC 61937
passthrough touch sound hardware, and how far each is verified differs by platform and by sink —
covered where it's most relevant rather than repeated here:

- [Windows](platforms/windows.md#audio-backend-wasapi) — `MonitorSink` is confirmed against real
  hardware; exclusive-mode passthrough bitstreaming has not been.
- [Linux](platforms/linux.md#what-has-and-has-not-been-verified) — the ALSA backend is verified
  headless only; no real S/PDIF or HDMI output has been tried.
- [macOS](platforms/macos.md#audio-backend-coreaudio) — the CoreAudio backend is CI-verified
  only: its device-free logic runs under `ac3tests` on hosted runners, but no real Mac hardware
  has ever run it.
- [Raspberry Pi](platforms/raspberry-pi.md#verified-configuration) — real-hardware validation on
  a Pi 4B: the full suite on both compilers, ALSA device enumeration against the Pi's real
  `vc4hdmi` HDMI outputs, and an inspected arm64 `.deb` — still with no downstream receiver in
  the loop.
- [Android (Shield Atmos Demo)](platforms/android.md#what-has-and-has-not-been-verified) — the
  most thoroughly hardware-verified platform in the project: real E-AC-3/Atmos passthrough over
  HDMI to a real AV receiver, with object audio confirmed reconstructable (not just the panned
  bed). Verification specific to this one Android app on this one Shield + receiver pair, not a
  general claim about Android as a platform.
- [Atmos & JOC](concepts/atmos-joc.md#two-honest-limitations) — Dolby's own decoder gates object
  decoding on a keyed authenticity tag; the signer ships in-tree (`ac3::signing`) but this
  project ships no key for it, so its streams are unsigned unless an operator supplies one.
  Objects sharing a direction also can't be perfectly separated. Neither is a conformance gap.
