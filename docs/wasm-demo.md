# Live decode demo (WASM)

`ac3::forge`'s decoder, compiled to WebAssembly, decoding a real E-AC-3
elementary stream entirely in your browser — no server-side decode, no
upload. This is the same C++ decode path `ac3cli decode` uses, running as
WASM instead of a native binary.

<!-- The iframe src below is raw HTML (md_in_html), which mkdocs passes through
     verbatim rather than rewriting the way it rewrites real markdown links -
     it has to be relative to this PAGE's own built URL (wasm-demo/index.html,
     directory URLs are on), hence "../". The markdown link further down is
     the opposite case: mkdocs rewrites markdown-syntax links itself, relative
     to this SOURCE file's own location (docs/wasm-demo.md, at the docs root),
     so it does NOT get a "../" even though it points at the same target. -->

## What's real

Everything: the decode, the audio, the per-channel bed energy driving the two
speaker rings (solid = ear-level, dashed = ceiling — ported from the desktop
GUI's `SoundfieldView.qml`), and — for a stream carrying Atmos objects — each
object's real decoded position (OAMD,
[`ac3::forge#168`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/pull/168)) moving
in the top-down/elevation room view, plus a "solo object" control that plays
that object's own real JOC-reconstructed audio
([`ac3::forge#169`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/pull/169)) — not
a re-panned approximation of its slice of the bed, its actual isolated
waveform. Drop in your own `.ec3`/`.ac3` file to decode something other than
the bundled fixture; a plain (non-Atmos) stream simply has zero objects.

## Source and how it's built

Source: [`apps/wasm/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/tree/main/apps/wasm) —
see [WebAssembly](platforms/wasm.md) for the build/toolchain details and what's reused vs. new. CI
rebuilds this embed fresh from source on every deploy to `main`; see
[Release / CI](platforms/wasm.md#release-ci).
