# ac3gui — window layout

`ac3gui` (window title `ac3forge — <source>` once a source is loaded, QML module `Ac3Forge`) is a
Qt Quick front end over the same
`ac3::forge` library documented under [Library](../library/index.md) — nothing in the GUI has
logic the library doesn't also expose, and every setting it makes maps onto an equivalent
[`ac3cli`](../cli/index.md) invocation shown live at the bottom of the window. See
[Installing](../cli/index.md#installing) for how to get it — winget ships `ac3gui` alongside
`ac3cli` in one package; Homebrew doesn't package the GUI, and every platform's release archive
carries it too.

The screenshots in this guide are of the current two-pane "workbench" layout, drawn in the
default **Signal** palette's light mode. The app ships four palettes — Signal (the design
system's red), Ink (a cooler blue), Console (studio amber), and **System**, which takes the
desktop's own accent colour (`QPalette::Accent`: the Windows accent, macOS's control accent,
KDE's — Qt fills it natively, falling back to the highlight colour elsewhere, and an accent
change in the OS Settings lands live). Each palette defines light **and dark by hand** — dark
is not a mechanical inversion of the light ramp. Both the mode (Light / Dark / System) and the
palette are set in [Preferences](#preferences). Earlier builds — a nine-card single-column design, and a first
cut of the workbench before the design handoff was fully implemented — are superseded; if you
find references to either elsewhere in the repo's history, they predate this guide.

## First run

Until a source has ever been chosen, the window shows a first-run screen instead of the workbench
— three ways in (a WAV file, a capture device, or a bundled 5.1 test signal the app synthesises
on the spot) and a one-sentence tour of the window:

![The first-run screen](screenshots/firstrun.png)

Any of those, plus dragging a file onto the window or launching `ac3gui path/to/file` from a
shell, works from the first-run screen or the workbench alike — a WAV becomes a source, an
already-encoded `.ac3`/`.ec3` opens in the [stream player](open-stream.md) instead. See [Loading a
source](loading-a-source.md#01-input).

## The window

Minimum size 1280×900. Two panes, divided by a vertical rule:

![The workbench: a 5.1 source loaded, Advanced tier](screenshots/overview-default.png)

- **Header** (top): the `ac3forge` wordmark and subtitle, a **Guided / Advanced / Expert**
  segmented control, a **QC a stream…** button (a separate dialog that measures an
  already-encoded file — see [QC a stream](qc.md)), an **Inspect objects…** button (its decode-side
  counterpart for Dolby Atmos object metadata/audio — see [Inspect objects](inspect-objects.md)),
  an **Open stream…** button (plays an already-encoded file and exports its decode — see
  [Open stream](open-stream.md)), and a **Preferences** button.
- **Left rail — "the signal"** (always visible, never scrolled away, and never affected by which
  tier is selected): three numbered blocks — **01 Input** (one input, with a **File / Live
  capture** selector, the loaded source list and its totals), **02 Levels** (the channel meters),
  and **03 Soundfield** (the plan views). This is what's coming *in* — see
  [Loading a source](loading-a-source.md).
- **Right panel — "the stream"**: a plan strip showing the derived output headline
  (`<codec> · <shape> · <bitrate> kbps · .<suffix>`, or `quality <n>` in VBR mode, or
  `5.1 bed + <n> objects` in object mode), a sub-line counting speakers, coded channels and
  dependent substreams, and the Annex E tools token on a chip. Beneath it, a tab bar (hidden in
  Guided, which fills the panel with its own steps) — tabs carry a badge counting their
  non-default settings, so a collapsed panel still declares itself.
- **Run strip** (bottom): past and in-flight runs — file encodes, recordings, and real live
  sessions alike — a compact **`ac3cli` command-line chip**, and the primary Encode button.
  Encode runs the encoder in-process, so the full command line is reference material rather
  than the primary act: clicking the chip opens a popover with the complete live-generated
  line (wrapped, with Copy). Present in every tier, including Guided — a codec developer must
  always be able to get back to a command line from what the UI shows, and the popover is one
  click away. The line is genuinely complete: extra
  sources ride as `src=`, the assignment as `map=`, non-default metadata in `print_meta_usage`'s
  own grammar, AC-3's bare `couple`, quoting where names carry spaces; a live source renders the
  `live` subcommand — a single command even with Matroska selected, via its `container=mkv` token
  (see [Live capture & session](live-session.md)) — while a *file* encode's Matroska container is
  honestly *two* commands (`… && ac3cli mkv …`), because pasting one would write a raw elementary
  stream into a file named `.mkv`. Finished
  chips carry **Show in folder** and **Play** — sends that run's own output to a receiver over the
  same IEC 61937 passthrough path the Format tab's own Passthrough section uses (see [Format &
  channels](format-and-channels.md#loudness-and-passthrough)), greyed out when no device here can
  bitstream what that particular run actually produced. A run encoded through Guided's **Play it on
  my receiver** destination (step 5) carries the device Guided already auto-picked along with it, so
  its Play needs no fresh device pick. **Clicking a chip's summary text** (the text is the click
  target — the status square and the chip's padding are inert, as are its buttons) opens that
  run's own details popover — status, rate, duration, size, frame count, the failure text if it
  failed, and the exact `ac3cli` command line as it stood *when that run started*, snapshotted
  rather than read live, so an old chip's popover still shows what actually ran even after the
  command bar above has since moved on. Failed and cancelled chips also say which they are, in the
  chip text itself, with a frame count and a distinct square; a failure's banner names the cause
  first and offers **Choose another device** / **Retry as file**; and a refusal that never opened a
  run (an incomplete assignment, the sixteen-object cap) lands in the same banner instead of only a
  status line. The strip's last thirty finished runs persist across a restart, restored alongside
  the "reopen the last session's sources" preference below.

## Guided, Advanced, Expert

- **Guided** (the default for a new session) replaces the tabbed right panel with a five-step
  sequence — **Audio**, **Speakers**, **Quality**, **Movement**, **Where it goes** — that reads
  and writes the exact same state Advanced and Expert do. There is no separate "wizard draft":
  switch tiers mid-session and whatever guided set is exactly what Advanced or Expert already
  show for the same field, and vice versa. The step bar and the assistant/Back/**Next** footer
  stay pinned; only the step content scrolls between them, and each new step opens at its own
  top — the way forward is never below the fold.

  ![Guided step 1 — Audio, with "What each sound does"](screenshots/guided-wizard-source.png)

  Guided is not a dead end and not a reduced feature set: step 1 carries its own **What each
  sound does** list — the same per-channel destination dropdowns as the
  [full assignment table](source-assignment.md), in plain language — and a jump to that table
  with a lossless **Back to guided** return. Step 2's speaker cards can open a **room picker**
  sub-screen (say what's *in the room*; the channel layout falls out of the parts). Step 3's
  **Good / Better / Best** rate cards set a fixed CBR bit rate (192 / 448 / 768 kbps) normally, or
  — when a VBR default (see Preferences below) or an already-selected Variable rate mode applies —
  a VBR quality target instead (40 / 75 / 90), since a fixed bit rate is not what either of those
  is actually asking for. Step 4's movement cards drive [object mode](objects-and-motion.md), with
  trajectory presets that author real keyframes; once objects are on, two more cards ask **what
  should move** — *Everything moves* rewrites every loaded channel's assignment to an object (no
  bed left underneath them), while *Keep the bed, add movers* leaves an existing mix exactly where
  it is and only turns still-unassigned channels (a file added since) into objects — both edit the
  same [assignment table](source-assignment.md) step 1 shows, so a later hand edit there always
  sticks. Step 5's **Play it on my receiver** destination auto-picks the first output device that
  can actually bitstream what is about to be encoded (the same "AC-3 + E-AC-3 ready" capability
  labelling the Format tab's own passthrough picker uses — see [Format &
  channels](format-and-channels.md#loudness-and-passthrough)), with a **Choose a different
  device →** link to override it and a stated reason when nothing here qualifies; encoding writes
  straight to the planned filename (no save dialog, since the real destination is the receiver) and
  the finished run's own **Play** action reuses that same device. Constraints apply the same way as
  everywhere else — they are explained rather than hidden (turning movement on says it fixed the
  bed at 5.1, rather than silently locking controls elsewhere).
- **Advanced** shows a tabbed right panel — [Format](format-and-channels.md) (presets, the
  channel picker, routing, the assignment table, a Loudness section) and
  [Objects](objects-and-motion.md).
- **Expert** adds the [Coding tools](coding-tools.md) and [Metadata](metadata.md) tabs (Metadata
  absorbs the Loudness section, so it appears exactly once). [Live session](live-session.md)
  joins the tab bar in Advanced and Expert whenever the live source is selected in the rail —
  sessions running or not — and carries a `live` badge while one runs.

Switching tiers never discards anything already set — it only changes what's visible (and, for
Guided, how it's presented: one question at a time instead of a page of controls). Leaving Expert
while a tab only it shows is current falls back to Format rather than showing an empty panel.

## The loudness contract

The app's own defaults are spec-neutral — dialnorm 31, no DRC, no measurement — the same values a
plan carries if nothing here ever touched it. Guided, while it is driving, layers a stronger
default on top: measured loudness and film-standard DRC, applied automatically once the flow
reaches its "What you are about to make" summary, so the summary already tells the truth before
Encode is ever pressed. This never overwrites an actual edit — the moment Loudness/Metadata is set
by hand (in Guided itself, or in Advanced/Expert during the same session), the contract steps aside
for good, this session, and dialnorm/DRC stay exactly what was set.

Dual mono (`1+1`) gets the same contract, applied to each of its two programmes independently —
see [Dual mono](format-and-channels.md#dual-mono) for why nothing is shared between them.

## Preferences

A real dialog, persisted across sessions (QSettings), three columns:

- **Appearance** — theme (Light / Dark / System) and the **palette** (Signal / Ink / Console /
  System — the last follows the desktop's accent colour where the platform exposes one); which
  meter rows to show by default ([Coded / Rendered](loading-a-source.md#02-levels));
  **Explanations** — show the plain-language notes beside controls, and optionally warn before
  a choice changes the codec (the codec follows the channels either way; the warning only makes
  the moment deliberate).
- **When ac3forge opens** — the Controls tier (including "whatever I used last"); reopen the
  last session's sources and assignments (saved as one unit on close, restored on open — a file
  gone missing fails its load with the usual message rather than aborting the rest); optionally
  start on the last screen. **Files and runs** — the output folder ("beside the first source" by
  default), the `{source}.{ext}` naming pattern every save dialog and auto-named take follows,
  and keep-partial-output: a failed or cancelled run's frames land beside the intended output as
  `<name>.partial.<ext>`, named and kept, never silently discarded.
- **Defaults for a new encode** — container, rate mode, bit rate, VBR quality, DRC profile,
  measure loudness. The codec is deliberately **not** a default — it follows the channels (see
  [Format & channels](format-and-channels.md)), and a stale default would contradict that.
  Clicking **Save** applies a changed default to whichever of these fields nothing has explicitly
  touched *this session* yet — the same contract [the loudness contract](#the-loudness-contract)
  already gives DRC profile and measure loudness, generalised to container/rate mode/bit
  rate/VBR quality too. An edit made before Save is never clobbered by it: touch a field once (in
  Guided, Advanced or Expert, any of them count) and Preferences stops overwriting it for the rest
  of the session, exactly as the loudness contract already promises for Loudness/Metadata.
  **Capture** — start monitoring as soon as a device is chosen, and whether Record asks for a
  filename or writes straight to the output folder under a timestamped take name. **Command
  line** — keep the `ac3cli` line visible.

## Next

The rest of the guide, in reading order:

1. [Loading a source](loading-a-source.md) — pick a WAV (or several), or capture live; watch the
   channel meters
2. [Format & channels](format-and-channels.md) — layout, dual mono, VBR, bit rate, container —
   and the assignment table everything else derives from
3. [Objects & motion](objects-and-motion.md) — Dolby Atmos objects
4. [Live capture & session](live-session.md) — capture → encode → monitor/passthrough, live
5. [Multi-source & assignment](source-assignment.md) — several sources at once, each channel
   individually assigned to a bed position, an object, or a dual-mono programme
6. [Coding tools](coding-tools.md) — Annex E tools (Expert; the tools apply to E-AC-3 only, and
   under AC-3 the tab shows an explainer instead)
7. [Metadata](metadata.md) — loudness, downmix, heavy compression (Expert)
8. [QC a stream](qc.md) — measure an already-encoded file against its own metadata, from the
   header's own dialog
9. [Inspect objects](inspect-objects.md) — see the Dolby Atmos object positions and audio a decoder
   actually recovers from an already-encoded file, from the header's own dialog
10. [Open stream](open-stream.md) — play an already-encoded file and export its decode, from the
    header's own dialog or a finished run's own **More…** menu

Or start with [Concepts](../concepts/index.md) if terms like "dependent substream" or "JOC" are
unfamiliar — the GUI uses the same vocabulary as the standards it implements.
