# Android (NVIDIA Shield)

Android support is not `ac3cli`/`ac3gui` ported to a phone — it is a separate, small,
Shield-specific demo app, **Shield Atmos Demo** (`apps/android/`), that plays a real Atmos/JOC
stream out through the Shield's HDMI passthrough output to an AV receiver, with a controller or
remote moving one of a few objects around the room live. It exists to prove the encoder's object
audio audibly moves in 3D space on real consumer hardware, not to be a general-purpose encoding
tool. This page covers what is specific to Android; for the core library and the desktop
platforms, see [Building from source](../building.md) and the other pages in this section.

Distribution is **personal sideload only, via `adb install` — never the Play Store**. That is a
deliberate choice, not a placeholder: the app can be built with [object signing](#object-signing)
enabled, and that build (which carries the key) must never leave the user's own device (see below).

## Build and run

An Android SDK with **NDK 26.1.10909125** and **CMake 3.31.6** installed (`local.properties` →
`sdk.dir`), plus a Shield TV reachable over the network or USB:

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
adb connect <shield-ip>:5555          # if not on USB
adb -s <shield-ip>:5555 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s <shield-ip>:5555 shell am start -n com.ac3forge.shield/.MainActivity
```

[Building and running](#building-and-running) below covers the SDK setup and signed builds.

## What's reused, what's new

`ac3::forge` (`src/forge/`) — the codec, `AtmosEncoder`, IEC 61937 framing — is fully
platform-independent and is linked into the app **unmodified**, via a thin wrapper
`CMakeLists.txt` (`apps/android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`) that `add_subdirectory()`s
the real repo root rather than duplicating its target definitions. `ac3::audio` (`src/audio/`)
gains its own backend, `src/audio/src/backend/android/`, alongside `windows`/`alsa`/`pipewire`/
`posix`/`macos`, selected by CMake's own `ANDROID` variable (set by the NDK toolchain file, a peer check
to the existing `WIN32`/`LINUX`/`APPLE` blocks in `src/audio/CMakeLists.txt`) — no `#ifdef`
anywhere, per the project's
[platform-tree convention](raspberry-pi.md#why-theres-no-raspberry-pi-specific-code).

Everything else — the Gradle app shell, the JNI bridge, the live encode loop, input handling, the
room visualization — is new and lives entirely under `apps/android/`, outside the CMake
project the desktop tools build from.

## Toolchain

**NDK r26.1.10909125**, pinned explicitly in `app/build.gradle.kts` rather than left to "whichever
NDK Gradle resolves" — a build failure should mean something changed, not that a different NDK got
silently picked. CMake **3.31.6** (the closest available match in the SDK manager's package
repository to the root project's declared `3.28...4.3` range; there is no 3.28.x package for
Android). `ANDROID_STL=c++_shared` — the app's `ac3::forge`/`ac3::audio` are static libraries
linked into one shared object (`ac3forge_jni.so`), and a static STL would duplicate global state
(locale, iostream init) if anything else in the process ever pulled in libc++ too.

The r26 pin also reaches into the library itself: r26's bundled libc++ does not implement
`<format>` at all unless the compiler is invoked with `-fexperimental-library`, which nothing in
this project's Android build passes. Rather than avoiding formatted output file by file to route
around that, the whole project uses [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) — `fmt::format`/
`fmt::print` in place of `std::format`/`std::print` everywhere, not just here — since {fmt} has no
such gap (see `cmake/Fmt.cmake` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s code-conventions section). That single
choice is also what lets `mp4::mp4`'s HLS/DASH signaling helpers build for Android at all; see the
note in `apps/android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` for why this app still doesn't link them
regardless (it never muxes a file).

The same libc++ implements only `<charconv>`'s **integer** `from_chars`, not its floating-point
overloads — a gap {fmt} does not close, since {fmt} only formats text *out*, the same direction
`std::format` goes. Library code that has to turn text *into* a `double` therefore uses `strtod`
instead (`src/forge/src/encoder/plan.cpp`, `encoder/assignment.cpp`,
`src/forge/src/oba/scene_text.hpp`, which also serves the object-scene file formats' parsing —
the write side of that same file goes through `fmt::format`, like everything else, once {fmt}
made that safe). The macOS wheel's own deployment target has the identical `from_chars` gap
(`'from_chars' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 26.0`) — {fmt}'s own vendored formatting avoids
the matching `to_chars` gap there (`'to_chars' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 13.3`) that a
raw `std::format` call would hit — so this leg and **Build wheels (macos-latest)** are the two
that catch a *parsing* regression; a *formatting* one shows up everywhere, same as any other
compile error.

`minSdk = 26` (Oreo) is a hard floor, not a target: `monitor.cpp` depends on AAudio outright, which
does not exist below API 26, and there is no fallback path. Real Shield TV hardware (2017 model
onward) ships well above this. Only `arm64-v8a` is built — every real Shield TV is arm64, and
building the other ABIs would only slow local iteration for targets that can never run the app.

## Audio backend: AAudio for monitor, JNI-bridged `AudioTrack` for passthrough

The original plan for this app was "native AAudio engine … using the existing IEC 61937
encapsulation" throughout. That premise turned out to be only half right, and is worth stating
explicitly so it is not rediscovered:

!!! warning "AAudio has no compressed/bitstream passthrough support at all"
    The NDK's AAudio API is PCM-only — confirmed against Oboe's own maintainers' guidance, not
    assumed. There is no AAudio call that hands a pre-framed IEC 61937 burst to an HDMI output and
    asks the receiver to decode it as Dolby Digital/Digital Plus. **Every real Android passthrough
    implementation** — Kodi's `AESinkAUDIOTRACK.cpp`, ExoPlayer's passthrough path — bypasses any
    native/codec API entirely and writes encoded, already-wrapped bursts into a **Java**
    `android.media.AudioTrack`, opened with a compressed encoding
    (`AudioFormat.ENCODING_E_AC3`/`ENCODING_IEC61937` — see below). This app does the same thing,
    just with a modern zero-copy JNI bridge instead of Kodi's older heap-array wrap.

    `AMediaCodec` (the NDK's native codec API) was considered and rejected for the same reason: it
    is a *decode/encode* pipeline API, with no mode for "inject an already-encoded bitstream
    verbatim onto passthrough output."

So the backend is genuinely split, unlike the other three:

- **`monitor.cpp`** — real AAudio (`AAudioStreamBuilder`, PCM float), for local preview. This is
  exactly what AAudio is good at, and the only place in this backend that uses it.
- **`passthrough.cpp`** — a JNI shim implementing `ac3::audio::PassthroughSink`. `submit()` hands
  each burst to a Kotlin-owned `AudioTrack` via a small round-robin pool of buffers wrapped once
  with `env->NewDirectByteBuffer(...)` and promoted to a `GlobalRef` at startup — one `memcpy` into
  a native buffer per burst, zero further copies, no per-frame `NewDirectByteBuffer`/GC churn.
  Kotlin's `PassthroughBridge.kt` opens the `AudioTrack` with `ENCODING_IEC61937` (bursts arrive
  already framed — `ENCODING_E_AC3` would make Android re-wrap already-wrapped frames) and writes
  with `WRITE_BLOCKING`.
- **`capture.cpp`** — a no-op stub, mirroring the `posix` backend's "no backend" shape. This app
  has no microphone/loopback feature to serve.
- **`audio_backend.cpp`** — reports `capture.available=false` unconditionally; `passthrough` and
  `monitor` availability come from a one-time capability probe at startup
  (`AudioTrack.isDirectPlaybackSupported`/`isPcmSupported`, called separately per format since
  AC-3 and E-AC-3 need different carrier rates — see `carrier_rate()` in `android_support.hpp`),
  not from a static claim.

## Real-time performance: `RelWithDebInfo`, and a real MDCT bug it uncovered

AGP's default for the `debug` build type is `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (`-O0`). That is fine for
`jni_entry.cpp`'s smoke tests but nowhere near real-time for `live_cursor.cpp`'s actual per-frame
work (`AtmosEncoder::encode_frame`'s MDCT/bit-allocation/JOC matrix, once every 32ms). Confirmed on
this Shield's Tegra X1: `-O0` took **~425ms/frame**, over 13x the budget — bursts arrived in huge
sparse gaps instead of a steady stream, which is exactly why the receiver's HDMI link stayed
flashing (video locked, audio never did). `app/build.gradle.kts`'s `debug` build type now overrides
this to `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`, which keeps the APK debuggable (`isDebuggable` stays
on, no separate release signing needed to `adb install`) while actually optimizing the native side.

That override alone only bought back ~1.6x — nowhere near enough. Profiling with
[Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) (`vcpkg`'s `profiling` manifest feature,
`AC3FORGE_ENABLE_TRACY`) traced the remaining gap to `mdct_forward_core`: it recomputed `std::cos()`
fresh, every iteration, inside an O(N²) loop, while the *inverse* transform right next to it already
used a precomputed table. Fixing the forward transform to do the same (`ForwardCosTable` in
`src/forge/src/core/mdct.cpp`) gave a further ~3.8x — this is a real library-level fix, verified
bit-exact against the full test suite, not an Android-specific workaround, and it benefits every
platform's Atmos encode path. With both fixes, the Shield holds an exact 32.0ms/frame cadence with
zero underruns. See [Performance trend](../performance-trend.md) for the CI regression gate this
bug prompted (`tests/performance/`'s hard real-time gate plus the `ac3bench` trend tracker).

## Objects: one interactive lead, two ambient, all on pre-planned orbits

`live_cursor.cpp` no longer holds a single object at a fixed point. Every object
(`kInteractiveObjects` + `kAmbientObjects`, currently 1 + 2) follows its own closed-form orbit —
`trajectory_position()`, a circle in the room's x/y plane centred on the room's *exact* middle
(`(0.5, 0.5)`, per `oamd.hpp` — also where the JOC/VBAP render implicitly assumes the listener
sits) with an independent, slower height bob — so every object's lap carries it both in front of
and behind the listening position, not confined to the front half of the room. Rate/phase/radius
differ per object (`kTrajectory`) so the three stay visually and audibly distinct.

The two ambient objects (a major third and a perfect fifth above the lead's A4, forming an A major
triad rather than an arbitrary tone set — `kToneHz`/`kToneGain`) are **never touched by input** —
they exist purely so the demo has more than one voice to show sound mixing/interaction between.
Only the lead is driven by [Input](#input-shield-controller-and-basic-remote-both) below.

**The lead's own voice is a bundled, seamlessly-looping sample, not a bare tone.** A plain sine,
however correctly panned, gives the ear almost nothing to localize by — no onset transient for
azimuth (interaural time/level difference) cues, and no high-frequency content at all for the
pinna-filtered spectral cues elevation localization actually relies on; real-device testing
confirmed it as "muddy," not a discrete point source. `assets/lead_voice_48k_mono_s16le.raw` (a
layered rotor-thump/tail-rotor/engine-drone/blade-slap mix, generated offline via FFT-based
spectral synthesis — random phase per frequency bin at exact multiples of `1/duration`, so the
inverse-FFT result is naturally periodic with no click at the loop seam) is loaded once at startup
through `AAssetManager` and looped sample-by-sample through the same `tone_gain`/distance-falloff/
soft-limiter chain every object's voice passes through. Missing the asset (an older build, or a
packaging issue) is not fatal: `live_cursor.cpp` falls back to a live-synthesized rotor-envelope
tone+noise mix instead of silence.

**Distance-based loudness falloff.** Without it, an object sounded exactly as loud swinging past the
listener at the room's centre as it did out at the far edge of its own orbit — correct panning
direction, but no sense of "coming toward me" versus "far away." An inverse-square-ish falloff
(`distance_attenuation()`, clamped with a floor so the far end of an orbit is quieter but never
silent — fully silent would fight the pause/mute isolation feature's own point) is applied as an
extra per-object, per-frame gain multiplier, computed from that frame's own placement.

## Input: Shield Controller and basic remote, both

`InputController.kt` supports both devices this app is meant to run under, detected at the event
level rather than requiring the user to pick a mode. Every input source **biases the lead object
off its own trajectory** rather than moving it outright (`NativeBridge.nativeDeflectSelectedObject`
→ `LiveCursorState::deflect_selected`, clamped to a bounding box around the trajectory) — release
the input and `LiveCursorState::advance()` decays that bias back toward zero every encode frame
(`kDeflectionDecayPerFrame`, an exp(-t/1.5s) time constant) whether or not any more input arrives,
so the object drifts back onto its planned course on its own rather than needing an explicit
"input stopped" signal from Kotlin.

- **Shield Controller** (`SOURCE_JOYSTICK`): both analog sticks, read in `onGenericMotionEvent`
  with a 0.15 deadzone, driving continuous deflection scaled by elapsed time via a
  `Choreographer.FrameCallback` ticker — held-stick input biases smoothly, not per-event-stepped.
  `L1`/`R1` add continuous height deflection independent of the D-pad's axis mode below.
- **D-pad** (present on both the Controller and the basic remote): now held-continuous rather than
  one-shot-per-press, unified into the same per-frame ticker as the analog sticks. Left/right
  always biases x; up/down biases **either** y (further into/out of the room) **or** z (height),
  depending on `axisMode` — the remote's only way to reach height at all, since it has no second
  stick or shoulder buttons.
- **Axis-mode toggle**: a **short press** of D-pad-center/Enter/A (`onKeyUp`, only fires if the
  long-press branch below didn't already consume the press) flips `axisMode` between X/Y and X/Z —
  deliberately immediate, not gated behind a hold, since real-device testing found a long-press-to-
  switch felt sluggish for something that needs switching back and forth rapidly while actively
  shaping a path. The top-down panel's header shows the current mode live (`D-PAD → DEPTH`/`D-PAD →
  HEIGHT`).
- **Snap back to course**: a **long press** of the same key (`onKeyLongPress`) instantly zeroes the
  selected object's deflection instead of waiting out the usual ~1.5s spring-back decay — a
  presenter's "and… reset" button. Replaced what used to be here (cycling the selected object, a
  no-op with only one interactive object).

Either way, input is coalesced to **at most one JNI call per animation frame**, never per raw input
event — the native side (`live_cursor.cpp`'s `LiveCursorState`, mutex-protected) advances once per
encode frame, independent of how often Kotlin's ticker calls in.

## Visualization

`RoomView.kt` is a plain `View` (not a `SurfaceView` — a handful of `drawCircle`/`drawLine` calls
per frame doesn't justify a `SurfaceView`'s own render thread and `SurfaceHolder` lifecycle),
invalidated once per vsync via `Choreographer.postFrameCallback`. Three panels, all reading the same
`NativeBridge.nativeGetObjectState()` snapshot the encode loop just built for that frame, laid out
as rounded cards on a shared dark palette (`Theme.kt` — one file of colors/corner-radii/spacing so
this view, `ChannelMeterView`, and `MainActivity`'s own chrome all read as one dashboard instead of
three separately-tuned screens):

- **3D track** (left, square) — a tilted isometric ("2:1 video-game style") projection showing all
  three room axes at once, plus the lead object's own trail (recent history behind it, faded;
  planned course ahead of it, queried fresh from native each frame with no deflection, since future
  input can't be known) with a drop-line from each trail point straight down to the floor, so height
  reads as an unambiguous vertical offset rather than a diagonal easy to misjudge in an oblique
  projection. Small `FRONT`/`BACK`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT` callouts sit just outside the floor plan's own
  edges — the one panel where the tilted angle alone doesn't make orientation obvious at a glance.
  Deliberately square, not a wide rectangle: the isometric projection's own natural bounding box is
  close to square, so a wider container mostly added dead margin rather than more visible content.
  Its header also carries a live encode-stats readout (`bursts N/N | encode X.Xms/32ms | Atmos
  (signed)`, underruns only appended when actually nonzero) — real-time viability was a genuine,
  previously-hit problem on this SoC (see
  [Real-time performance](#real-time-performance-relwithdebinfo-and-a-real-mdct-bug-it-uncovered)
  above), so showing the live number is worth more here than in most encode loops.
- **Top-down (X/Y)** and **elevation (X/Z)** (right, side by side, not stacked — each gets the full
  panel height this way instead of half of it) — the selected (lead) object ringed, a white diamond
  marking the listener at the room's exact centre (both panels' (0.5, 0.5) — see
  [Objects](#objects-one-interactive-lead-two-ambient-all-on-pre-planned-orbits) above), and, on the
  top-down panel, a faint dashed guide circle showing the lead's planned orbit so a viewer can see it
  pushed off course and springing back rather than just a dot moving with no reference
  (`kTrajectoryGuideRadius`, duplicated from `live_cursor.cpp`'s `kTrajectory[0].radius` — kept in
  sync by comment on both ends, not queried over JNI, since it's fixed at compile time on both). Each
  panel's own plotted room stays a true square, centred inside whatever rectangle its card actually
  is — both axes share the same normalized `[0,1]` scale, so a non-square plot would stretch one
  axis relative to the other and turn the (genuinely circular) guide into a misleading ellipse.
- **Speaker activity (bed)** (bottom-left, alongside the control hints, not its own full-width row —
  kept deliberately compact, since it's "interesting, but doesn't need to be prominent") — a
  segmented, LED-style meter per real bed channel (`StreamStats::channel_levels`, sourced from
  `AtmosEncoder::bed()` — the literal audio a legacy 5.1 decoder hears, not a guess from the room-
  position math), with a bottom-to-top color ramp and a slowly-decaying peak-hold line, the same
  "catch the loudest recent moment" behavior a real hardware VU meter has.

Two transient overlays, sharing one `TextView` (mutually exclusive by construction) rather than
competing for the same screen space:

- **First-launch orientation cue** — "This is the front wall / Up on the stick/D-pad = toward the
  screen," shown once, the first time the receiver becomes ready (immediately at launch, or after
  some [waiting](#hdmi-receiver-resilience-waiting-not-crashing) — never while still waiting, which
  would just be confusing). Dismissed by the first real input, or auto-fades after 5s.
- **Idle/attract prompt** — "Press any button to take control," shown after 14s of no input (a demo
  left alone between visitors should invite the next person, not just sit there), dismissed the
  instant real input resumes.

![First-launch orientation cue over the 3D track panel](screenshots/android-orientation-cue.png)

## HDMI receiver resilience: waiting, not crashing

Earlier hands-on use surfaced a real annoyance: if the AVR/receiver was off (or not yet HDMI-
negotiated) at launch, or got powered off mid-session, the app just sat there having silently done
nothing — the only fix was a force-restart, timed for whenever the receiver happened to be ready.
`MainActivity.reconcileReceiverState()` closes that gap: `nativeStartLiveCursor()` is no longer
called unconditionally in `onCreate` — it's gated on the receiver actually accepting E-AC3 right
now, re-evaluated on every `AudioManager.ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG` broadcast (the system's own
"HDMI audio route capabilities changed" signal — receiver on/off, input switched, EDID
renegotiated) and on a slow (2.5s) periodic fallback, since that broadcast isn't guaranteed on every
real AVR power-off (some receivers don't change their reported EDID/HPD state on standby). A
persistent, full-screen "Waiting for receiver…" interstitial covers the dashboard until then, and
disappears on its own once streaming actually starts — no restart, ever.

![Waiting-for-receiver interstitial, shown until the AVR is detected](screenshots/android-waiting-for-receiver.png)

!!! warning "`AudioTrack.isDirectPlaybackSupported()` blocks indefinitely against your own active track"
    Getting this right took two real bugs found on hardware, not just review — worth stating
    explicitly so neither is rediscovered the hard way again:

    **The capability probe hangs, not fails, if called while a direct `AudioTrack` on the same
    route is already open or still opening.** The obvious design — poll
    `isDirectPlaybackSupported()` on a timer regardless of state, start/stop the loop based on the
    result — froze the whole Activity on its own splash screen forever (main thread confirmed idle
    via `dumpsys`, no exception, the encode loop itself kept streaming happily underneath) the
    moment that poll landed while the loop's `AudioTrack` was live, almost certainly audio-policy-
    manager lock contention rather than a bug in the probe itself. The same hang recurred calling
    it again moments after `nativeStartLiveCursor()`, before that background thread's own
    `AudioTrack.Builder().build().play()` had resolved — opening a track contends the same way an
    already-playing one does. `reconcileReceiverState()` now probes capability **only** when
    `NativeBridge.nativeIsLiveCursorRunning()` is false *and* no start attempt is still within a
    3s grace period (`START_ATTEMPT_GRACE_MS`); detecting a receiver disappearing **while already
    streaming** instead watches `NativeBridge.nativeGetUnderrunCount()` (the same
    `StreamStats::underruns` counter `submit()` already tracked) for a rise, since a real AVR loss
    shows up as failed `AudioTrack.write()` calls, and this needs no further call into
    `AudioTrack` at all.

    **A view's default visibility has to match its state variable's own default, or the first
    "no change" transition never applies either.** The waiting overlay started `GONE` while
    `receiverReady` started `false` (Kotlin's own default) — consistent-looking, but
    `setReceiverReady()` only touches the view on an actual *change* (`ready == receiverReady`
    short-circuits otherwise), so a receiver absent from the very first check (`false -> false`,
    no change) left the overlay hidden and the full (empty, zeroed) dashboard showing instead —
    confirmed on a real device screenshot. Fixed by defaulting the overlay to `VISIBLE`, matching
    `receiverReady`'s own `false` default.

## Object signing

!!! warning "Object motion is audible even without this — but not as reconstructable objects"
    `AtmosEncoder` pans every object into the transmitted 5.1 bed regardless of signing status
    (see `atmos.hpp`), so a plain, unsigned build of this app already produces audible movement
    on any decoder — panned across the fixed channel layout. What signing adds is the *object*
    audio: a real Dolby-licensed decoder gates JOC object decode on a keyed HMAC over the EMDF
    protection field. The algorithm that produces that tag is in-tree; the key it needs is not.

The signer is `ac3::signing` (`src/signing/`) — committed, clean-room and dependency-free, the
same library `ac3cli` uses. Its full design (what's signed, why the algorithm is committable but
the key isn't) is in [Object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md); this section covers only what
is specific to the app. The app's seam is `shield_signing_hook.{hpp,cpp}`, one committed
translation unit — no stub/enabled split and no CMake option any more, because there is no secret
in the code to keep out of a build. It signs **per frame**, right after `encode_frame()` and before
IEC 61937 wrapping, since it streams live rather than writing a file.

**The key is a bundled asset, written from a CI secret.** The desktop CLI takes a key by path or
env var, but this app signs on-device, so the key has to travel in the APK as an asset,
`app/src/main/assets/signing.key`. That file is **gitignored** and is materialized at build time —
CI writes the base64 `ATMOS_SIGNING_KEY` secret verbatim into it (`.github/workflows/_build.yml`),
or you drop one in by hand for a local signed build. `init_signing()` loads it once through the same
`AAssetManager` the lead-voice asset uses and decodes it (base64 or raw) via the same
`ac3::signing::decode_signing_key()` the CLI applies.

**Unsigned builds omit the object container entirely, not just leave it unsigned.** An unsigned
but *present* EMDF container is not a safe degraded mode — per `AtmosConfig::emit_object_metadata`'s
own comment, a decoder that validates the `emdf_protection` field treats the container's sync word
as a commitment to object decoding and refuses the whole stream if it doesn't validate, rather than
falling back to plain 5.1. `shield_signing_hook.hpp`'s `signing_available()` (`true` only once a key
asset actually loaded) lets `live_cursor.cpp` decide this once at startup: `emit_object_metadata`
is set to `signing_available()`, so a keyless build runs the same `bed51` mode `ac3cli mode bed51`
exposes — no container at all, always safe, on every receiver — while only a build carrying the key
ever emits and signs one.

To build a signed APK on your own machine, drop your own `signing.key` (base64 or raw bytes) into
`app/src/main/assets/` — gitignored, so `git status` never shows it — and build as normal:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

!!! danger "A signed APK contains the key"
    Because the app signs on-device, the key ships **inside** any signed-build APK as that asset —
    anyone with the APK can extract it. A signed APK is therefore as sensitive as the key itself:
    sideload it to your own Shield via `adb install` and never distribute it. A build without the
    asset is the safe unsigned app and has nothing to revert.

## Building and running

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
adb connect <shield-ip>:5555          # if not on USB
adb -s <shield-ip>:5555 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s <shield-ip>:5555 shell am start -n com.ac3forge.shield/.MainActivity
```

`local.properties` needs `sdk.dir` pointing at an Android SDK with NDK 26.1.10909125 and CMake
3.31.6 installed (via Android Studio's SDK Manager, or `sdkmanager --install`). For a local *signed*
build, also drop a `signing.key` asset into `app/src/main/assets/` as described in
[Object signing](#object-signing).

## Release / CI

The app builds alongside the desktop packages rather than only ever being hand-built locally:
`.github/workflows/_build.yml`'s `build-android` job builds the **debug** variant on every push
(no Android SDK/NDK setup beyond what `ubuntu-latest` ships plus an explicit pin of the exact NDK
version, `26.1.10909125`, the same "don't trust whatever the image happens to cache" reasoning
every other toolchain step in that workflow already follows) — a continuous smoke test proving the
Gradle/CMake/NDK toolchain and every native source file still build, the same role `windows-msvc`'s
always-on packaging step plays for the desktop legs. **Object signing is gated purely on the
`ATMOS_SIGNING_KEY` secret, not on whether this is a release.** Both `ci.yml` and `release.yml`
forward that secret, so if it is set, *every* Shield build — the always-on debug APK included —
bundles the key asset and signs; with no secret the step is skipped and the build is the unsigned
bed51 app.

For an actual release (`release.yml`, `do_package: true`), the same job also builds and stages the
**release** variant (`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`) as `ac3forge-shield-<version>.apk`. A separate,
independent signature — *APK code-signing* — also applies to it: the APK is signed with a real
release keystore when `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and its companion secrets are provisioned (see
`build.gradle.kts`'s `releaseSigningAvailable`), and falls back to the debug keystore otherwise —
this app is sideload-only, so the release key matters only for update-signature continuity, not a
store requirement. (Object signing above is unrelated to this APK keystore; a signed-objects APK
carries the key and must not be distributed — see [Object signing](#object-signing).) The
APK is uploaded as a `packages-android` artifact and folded into the
GitHub Release alongside the Windows/Linux/macOS packages (checksummed, GPG-signed, and
build-provenance-attested exactly like every other package — `release.yml`'s artifact globs all
include `*.apk`).

**Promoted, not experimental.** This job used to run `continue-on-error: true`, before it had ever
actually run on GitHub's hosted runners. It has since gone green three consecutive times on real
hosted runners (`feature/shield-atmos-platform`'s own PR history) — comfortably past the bar
`macos-llvm` was promoted at — so that line is gone: a `build-android` failure now blocks like
every other required leg.

## What has and has not been verified

!!! note "Verified on real hardware"
    Installed, launched, and run repeatedly on the developer's own Shield (Tegra X1 SoC) connected
    to a real AV receiver over HDMI, across every round of feature work described on this page, not
    just the initial one. The encode loop holds exact real-time cadence (32.0ms/frame, zero
    underruns) for extended runs. Both Shield Controller analog input and D-pad/remote-style input
    (the latter verified via `adb shell input keyevent` injection) move the correct object; the
    pre-planned orbit trajectory, input-driven deflection with spring-back, the snap-back long
    press, the axis-mode toggle, and the two ambient objects have all been exercised live and the
    room visualization tracks the encode loop's own state throughout.

    **The object-signed build's object audio has been confirmed reconstructable on the real
    receiver** — not just the always-audible panned bed. With the delta-bit-allocation fix
    described in the signer's own history (an unrelated bit-tracking bug that had been silently
    corrupting a large fraction of signed frames) and the real receiver powered on and HDMI-linked,
    the receiver's own front-panel display read **Atmos/DD+, 48kHz in, 5.0.4 out**, and the object's
    motion was audible. This resolves what had been an open question in
    [Two honest limitations](../concepts/atmos-joc.md#two-honest-limitations) for this specific
    encoder/signer pair, though the general caveat there still applies to any *other* clean-room
    encoder without a matching signing key.

    **The bundled lead-voice asset loads and streams cleanly** (`loaded lead voice asset: 192000
    samples (4.00s)` in logcat, zero underruns through extended runs), and the dashboard redesign —
    the 3D/top-down/elevation three-panel layout, the speaker-activity meter, the first-launch
    orientation cue, and the idle/attract prompt — has been confirmed rendering correctly via real
    device screenshots (`adb shell screencap`), not just compiled.

    **HDMI receiver resilience** (see [that section](#hdmi-receiver-resilience-waiting-not-crashing)
    above) has been verified in full on real hardware, including the two scenarios that can only be
    tested by physically power-cycling the AVR — turning the receiver on after the app has already
    launched waiting, and losing the receiver mid-session — both confirmed working without a
    force-restart. The happy path (receiver already on at launch) and the waiting-screen UI itself
    were verified directly; the two power-cycle scenarios were confirmed by the developer on the
    physical device.

    Both the release (unsigned) and local-signed debug builds install and launch without crashing;
    the release build's logcat confirms `object container: bed51 (omitted, unsigned build)` — the
    safe public default actually takes effect, not just compiles. `build-android` has itself now run
    green three consecutive times on GitHub's hosted runners — see [Release / CI](#release-ci) above.

!!! note "Automated in CI (roadmap VX18b)"
    `apps/android/app/src/androidTest/` adds `NativeBridgeInstrumentedTest` and
    `PassthroughBridgeInstrumentedTest`, which `build-android` runs on every build via
    `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` against a GitHub-hosted API-30 x86_64 emulator
    (KVM acceleration is x86/x86_64-only on those runners, so the debug build type targets
    x86_64 alongside the real device's arm64-v8a; release stays arm64-v8a-only). Before this,
    nothing ran any Kotlin-level test at all — only `tests/backend/android/`'s C++-side
    device-free logic (burst sizing, carrier rate, render-device construction) on the ordinary
    desktop-hosted CTest suite. Every emulator case is a **"no receiver attached" contract
    check**: the emulator runs `-noaudio`, which makes `isDirectPlaybackSupported` deterministically
    false, so what these assert is that the JNI round trip and the `AudioTrack`/`AudioFormat`
    calls fail safely rather than throwing or hanging.

!!! warning "Not yet verified"
    The emulator tests above cover the device-free contract, not the passthrough path itself:
    everything this section claims about a receiver actually locking on — the format negotiation,
    the Atmos indicator, the HDMI resilience scenarios — is manual verification on one specific
    Shield + receiver pair, not a repeatable check. Other Android TV hardware (a different SoC, a
    different receiver's own EDID/HDMI behavior) is untested. Along with
    [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md#live-hdmi-passthrough-to-a-real-receiver), which drives a real
    Atmos AVR from a Pi 4B, this is one of only two platform pages in the project where anything
    has run on real target hardware with a real receiver attached — a platform's CI legs passing
    (Linux's `alsa` backend included) is a materially different claim than "installed and run on a
    real device", and should not be read as implying it.
