# Raspberry Pi

ac3forge runs on Raspberry Pi as a plain **aarch64 Debian/Ubuntu Linux** target, not through any
Pi-specific code. This page covers what's specific to that arm64 target and its HDMI output; for the
general Linux picture (toolchains, the ALSA backend, the GUI, packaging), see
[Linux](linux.md) and [Building from source](../building.md) - everything there applies here
unchanged, just with `-arm64` presets.

## Why there's no Raspberry Pi-specific code

The project's backend tree (`src/audio/src/backend/{windows,alsa,pipewire,posix,macos,android}/`,
selected by `src/audio/CMakeLists.txt`, never by `#ifdef` -
`tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1` enforces this in CI)
branches on **operating system**, not architecture or device. A Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS
hits exactly the same `if(LINUX)` branch, the same ALSA backend, and the same
[HDMI/S-PDIF passthrough device-naming logic](linux.md#audio-backend-alsa-or-pipewire) that any x86_64
Debian box does. Enabling this target was almost entirely CMake/vcpkg/CI plumbing - see the two new
`arm64-linux-{gcc,llvm}` vcpkg overlay triplets (`cmake/vcpkg/triplets/`) and the
`config-linux-{gcc,llvm}-arm64[-debug]` presets they back, mirroring the existing `arm64-macos-llvm`
triplet Apple Silicon already uses.

## Supported hardware

| Model | Status |
|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | Supported. Validated hardware - see [Verified configuration](#verified-configuration) below. |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Expected to work identically (same BCM27xx SoC family, same `vc4`/`v3d` HDMI/GPU driver stack as the Pi 4) but **not yet validated on real Pi 5 hardware** - don't take this as tested until this page says otherwise. |
| Raspberry Pi 3 | **Not a supported target.** It would resolve through the exact same untested arm64 build path, but its Cortex-A53 CPU is materially weaker than the Pi 4/5's Cortex-A72/A76, and `tests/performance/test_performance.cpp`'s `ac3perf` suite gates on a hard real-time encode budget - there's a real risk some layouts simply don't make it in time on that CPU class. Building it is possible; it just isn't validated or promised to keep up in real time. |

A 64-bit OS is required (`aarch64`, not `armhf`/`armv7`) - the project defines no 32-bit ARM triplet,
and none is planned.

## Requirements

Same as [Linux](linux.md#toolchains) generally, but Raspberry Pi OS's own package archive (Debian
13 "Trixie" as of this writing) doesn't necessarily carry the exact GCC 16 / Clang 22 versions CI
pins. `cmake/toolchains/linux.{gcc,llvm}.toolchain.cmake` already `find_program` a fallback list
(`gcc-16, gcc, gcc-15, gcc-14, gcc-13` / `clang-22, clang, clang-21, clang-20`), so an older distro compiler
is picked up automatically - the version pin is a CI reproducibility choice, not a hard requirement
of the code. See [Verified configuration](#verified-configuration) for what was actually resolved on
real hardware.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config git \
    libasound2-dev \
    qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools qt6-declarative-dev qt6-declarative-dev-tools
```

Building with the LLVM preset instead of GCC additionally needs `clang-<N>` and, less obviously,
**`clang-tools-<N>`** (owns `clang-scan-deps-<N>`, which CMake's Ninja generator shells out to for
every C++20/23 translation unit's module-dependency scan, not just files using `import`/`export`):

```bash
sudo apt install clang-19 lld-19 clang-tools-19
```

Without `clang-tools-<N>`, configure fails confusingly - every `find_package`-driven try_compile
(Qt6, Threads, ALSA) fails too, since they all hit the same missing `clang-scan-deps` binary, which
reads like broken dependency detection rather than a missing package. Substitute Trixie's actual
`clang`/`lld`/`clang-tools` version for `19` if a future Raspberry Pi OS release ships something
newer.

## Building

Identical to [Building on Linux](../building.md#building-on-linux), with `-arm64` appended to the
preset name:

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/opt/vcpkg
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON
cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc-arm64-debug
ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-arm64-debug
```

Substitute `linux-llvm-arm64` for `linux-gcc-arm64` to build with Clang instead - same tradeoff as on
x64. `VCPKG_ROOT` only ever supplies Catch2, exactly as on every other platform.

## HDMI output

The Pi's only audio-capable HDMI path is its VideoCore HDMI ALSA card, normally exposed under a name
like `vc4-hdmi` (`bcm2835` on older firmware/kernel combinations). ac3forge doesn't special-case
this name - `src/audio/src/backend/alsa/device_names.hpp`'s `classify_digital_output()` already
recognizes any ALSA PCM whose name contains `hdmi` and builds the IEC 60958 channel-status device
string generically. Find the real name on a given Pi with:

```bash
aplay -L
build/config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug/bin/ac3cli outputs
```

See [Verified configuration](#verified-configuration) for the exact device name found during
hardware validation.

## Packaging

```bash
cpack --preset pack-linux-gcc-arm64
```

Produces an arm64-labeled `.tar.gz`, plus a `.deb` (`Architecture: arm64`, auto-detected by CPack's
DEB generator via `dpkg --print-architecture` on the build host - nothing here hardcodes an
architecture) and `.rpm` on top when the corresponding tool is on `PATH`. See
[Packaging](../building.md#packaging) for the general shape, and
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published) for what a tagged release actually
publishes.

## Verified configuration

Run for real, over SSH, on:

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B rev 1.1 (2GB) |
| OS | Raspberry Pi OS 13 "Trixie" (Debian 13.6 base), kernel 6.18.34+rpt-rpi-v8 |
| Compilers | GCC 14.2.0 and Clang 19.1.7 (Trixie's apt archive; Trixie has no `gcc-16`/`clang-22` yet - the toolchain files' fallback `find_program` list picked these up automatically, no configuration needed) |
| CMake | 3.31.6, Ninja 1.12.1 |
| Qt | 6.8.2, apt-packaged (`qt6-base-dev`, `qt6-declarative-dev`) |
| ALSA | `libasound2-dev` 1.2.14 |
| vcpkg | checkout at `/opt/vcpkg` |

Both `config-linux-gcc-arm64[-debug]` and `config-linux-llvm-arm64[-debug]` configure, build and
`ctest` all clean: **440/440 tests passing on both compilers**, including the `Performance` label
(`ac3perf`'s hard real-time encode gate) - both the Atmos/JOC and plain 5.1 encoders stay comfortably
inside their real-time budget on this hardware, and the Qt Quick Test GUI harness
(`ac3gui_qmltests`) passes headless. `ac3gui --smoke` (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) also runs clean,
encoding real audio and instantiating real QML channel meters. A full Release build (`config-linux-gcc-arm64`)
and `cpack --preset pack-linux-gcc-arm64` were also run for real, producing a `.deb` with
`Architecture: arm64` and a correctly auto-resolved Qt runtime `Depends:` list (`libqt6core6t64`,
`libqt6gui6`, `libqt6qml6`, `libqt6quick6`, `libqt6quickcontrols2-6`, plus `libasound2t64`) - this Pi's
Qt6 came from apt, confirming for the first time on real hardware that `cmake/Packaging.cmake`'s "a
system Qt6 install resolves fine through `dpkg-shlibdeps` alone" note holds in practice, not just in
theory.

Builds are slow on this hardware and RAM-constrained (2GB, 4 cores) - a full `-j2` build (CLI, GUI,
tests, all examples) takes roughly 17-22 minutes depending on Debug/Release and compiler; `-j4`
wasn't tried, to leave headroom against OOM.

**Two real, compiler/distro-specific issues were found and fixed by this validation, not
hypothetical:**

1. GCC 14.2.0 at `-O2`/`-O3` (Release only - not seen at Debug) emits a false-positive
   `-Wnull-dereference` inside libstdc++'s own `<streambuf>`/`<bits/stl_construct.h>` internals,
   promoted to a hard error by this project's `-Werror` policy. Not seen on GCC 15, and CI has
   since moved on to GCC 16 (see [Linux](linux.md#toolchains)), where a *different* false
   positive - a `-Warray-bounds` misfire on a short-circuited array access, also inside
   libstdc++, also `-O2`/`-O3`-only - shows up instead. Both are fixed in
   `cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake`, scoped to `GCC < 15` and `GCC >= 16` respectively, so the
   CI-pinned toolchain (both x64 and arm64) only carries the suppression it actually needs.
2. CMake's Ninja generator shells out to `clang-scan-deps` for every C++20/23 translation unit's
   module-dependency scan (not just files using `import`/`export`) - without it, every
   `find_package`-driven `try_compile` (Qt6, Threads, ALSA) fails the same way, which reads as
   broken dependency detection rather than a missing package. `clang-scan-deps-<N>` lives in
   `clang-tools-<N>`, a package neither `clang-<N>` nor `llvm-<N>` pull in. Fixed by adding
   `clang-tools-${LLVM_VERSION}` to `.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh`'s package list -
   unconditionally, since every Linux LLVM leg configures the same way regardless of which distro's
   package split happens to be exercising the gap.

**Real ALSA/HDMI device names found**:

```
hdmi:CARD=vc4hdmi0,DEV=0   # HDMI port 0
hdmi:CARD=vc4hdmi1,DEV=0   # HDMI port 1 (the 4B has two micro-HDMI outputs)
hw:CARD=Headphones,DEV=0   # bcm2835 analogue out, not HDMI
```

These names exist and are well-formed, but - see the next section - nothing had actually walked
the device *classifier* against them with a receiver in the loop yet at this point in the
validation, and that turned out to matter.

## Live HDMI passthrough to a real receiver

Verified for real: an Atmos-capable AVR connected to HDMI port 0 and powered on, driven from this
same Pi and checkout. This closes the one gap the section above left open, and found a third real
bug on the way.

**A third real, hardware-only bug:** `classify_digital_output()` (`device_names.hpp`) judges a
PCM's kind from the name alsa-lib's `snd_pcm_info_get_name()` gives it - "HDMI 0", "IEC958", etc.
on most drivers. vc4-hdmi doesn't follow that convention: every one of its PCMs is named
identically, `MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0`, regardless of which HDMI port it is - "hdmi" only ever appears
in the *card's* own id (`vc4hdmi0`) and name (`vc4-hdmi-0`), which the classifier never looked at.
The result: every vc4-hdmi candidate silently classified as `kNone` and was dropped, so `ac3cli
outputs` reported "no active render endpoints found" even with the receiver fully connected,
EDID-populated, and its `HDMI Jack` ALSA control reading `on`. Fixed by falling back to the card's
id/name when the PCM's own name gives no signal; a regression test in `test_alsa_device_names.cpp`
pins the vc4-hdmi case specifically, alongside the existing HDA-style cases it doesn't change.

With the fix, `ac3cli outputs` reports both HDMI ports correctly:

```
idx  AC-3       E-AC-3     excl PCM   name
  0  yes        yes        no         vc4-hdmi-0: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0  [default]
  1  no         no         no         vc4-hdmi-1: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0
```

(Port 1's all-`no` row is correct, not a bug - nothing is connected to it.)

**Every stream shape tried locked on the real receiver, correctly identified:**

| Stream | Result |
|---|---|
| Plain AC-3, 2/0 stereo | Dolby Digital, 2ch |
| Plain E-AC-3, 2/0 stereo | Dolby Digital Plus, 2ch |
| Plain E-AC-3, 5.1 (no object container) | Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 |
| Atmos `bed51` (5.1 bed, no object container) | Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 |
| Atmos `objects`, unsigned (object container present, no EMDF tag) | Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 - a graceful fallback, not the hard refusal [object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md#desktop-cli) warns an unsigned-but-present container can get from a validating decoder. This receiver falls back gracefully instead. |
| Atmos `objects`, signed with a real Dolby encoder license key (key and signed assets not part of this repo - see [object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md)) | Atmos confirmed on the receiver's own OSD, 4 height channels active (5.0.4 layout) |

Every case submitted its bursts cleanly - `ac3cli play`'s own stats read 0 underruns throughout,
every time. A couple of early runs looked like they hadn't synced, but that was purely down to the
short (12 s) clips ending before the receiver's own display could be checked in time; the same
files replayed and locked correctly once watched for their full length. Nothing here needed a
longer runway than that to lock - once the classifier fix above landed, every stream shape locked
on the first real attempt.

This closes the [Linux](linux.md#audio-backend-alsa-or-pipewire) page's still-open gap for HDMI
passthrough on Raspberry Pi specifically: verified end to end now, from plain AC-3 through
Atmos/JOC with height rendering, against a real Dolby-licensed decoder.
