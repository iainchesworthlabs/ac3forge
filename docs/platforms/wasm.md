# WebAssembly (browser decode demo)

WASM support is not `ac3cli` ported to a browser — it is a small, decode-only demo app,
**`apps/wasm/`**, that compiles `ac3::forge`'s AC-3/E-AC-3 decoder to WebAssembly and runs it
client-side in a static HTML page: load a real elementary stream, hear the decoded bed play through
the Web Audio API, watch real per-channel energy on a speaker-ring visualization, and — for a stream
carrying Atmos objects — watch each object's real decoded position (OAMD) move in a room view and
solo its own real reconstructed audio (JOC). It exists to prove the decoder runs correctly outside a
native process, and to give the documentation site a live demo (see
[Live decode demo](../wasm-demo.md)) — not to be a general-purpose in-browser tool. This page covers
what is specific to WASM; for the core library and the desktop platforms, see
[Building from source](../building.md) and the other pages in this section.

Decode-only, deliberately: WASM-encode is a separate, much larger undertaking (real-time MDCT/bit-
allocation/JOC matrix work in a browser thread) and isn't attempted here.

## Build and run

An [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) on `PATH`
(`source <emsdk>/emsdk_env.sh` / `emsdk_env.bat`/`.ps1`), then:

```bash
cmake --preset config-wasm-emscripten
cmake --build build/config-wasm-emscripten
cd build/config-wasm-emscripten/bin/wasm_decode_demo
python3 -m http.server 8000   # ES modules and fetch() need http(s), not file://
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/`.

## What's reused, what's new

`ac3::forge` (`src/forge/`) — the codec, `FrameDecoder`/`Eac3Decoder`, elementary-stream scanning — is
fully platform-independent and is linked into the demo **unmodified**, the same way `apps/wasm/CMakeLists.txt`
links it as any other consumer would: `add_executable` + `target_link_libraries(... ac3::forge ...)`,
no fork, no `#ifdef`. Unlike `apps/android/`, this doesn't need a separate build system reached
from the other direction — WASM is a plain CMake cross-compile, so `apps/wasm/` is a normal
`add_subdirectory()` from the root `CMakeLists.txt`, gated on `EMSCRIPTEN` (set by
`cmake/toolchains/wasm.emscripten.toolchain.cmake`) rather than an `AC3FORGE_BUILD_*` option.
`ac3::audio` (`src/audio/`) gains **no** WASM backend — there is no live-capture/passthrough
equivalent to add; a browser gets audio playback from the Web Audio API in JavaScript instead, and
`src/audio` is skipped from the configure entirely under `EMSCRIPTEN` (it hard-fails otherwise, for
having no browser platform directory — see `src/audio/CMakeLists.txt`).

Everything else — `decoder_bindings.cpp` (the Embind wrapper), `index.html`/`demo.js` (the page, Web
Audio playback, the Canvas visualizations ported from `apps/gui/qml/SoundfieldView.qml` and Main.qml's
Objects tab) — is new and lives entirely under `apps/wasm/`, outside anything the desktop tools
build from. The object visualization/audio is a thin JS-facing surface over `Eac3Decoder`'s own real
`object_metadata` (OAMD positions/gain, `ac3::forge#168`) and `object_audio` (JOC-reconstructed
per-object audio, `ac3::forge#169`) fields — `decoder_bindings.cpp` does no decoding of its own, it
just accumulates what `Eac3Decoder` already produced per frame and exposes it as typed-array views.

What counts as "an object" there is every JOC output, which `ac3::oba::describe_objects()` spells
out: a dynamic object supplies its own position, size and gain, and a bed channel — what
channel-based-immersive third-party content carries — is drawn at the nominal room position of the
speaker its label names, with that label on its solo button. Each object's per-frame record also
carries TS 103 420 §5.6.1.2's extent, so a sized object draws bigger than a point source.

One wrinkle worth knowing when previewing locally: `docs/assets/wasm-decode-demo/` holds a
*committed* `ac3forge_decode.wasm` that only the docs deploy job rebuilds, so a local `mkdocs
serve` can be running an older module than the checked-in `demo.js`. `demo.js` therefore feature-
detects the newer bindings and derives its per-object record stride from the data rather than
hard-coding it.

## Toolchain

No vcpkg. Every other platform preset in `CMakePresets.json` chainloads through vcpkg for
consistency, but `ac3::forge`'s decode path has zero third-party dependencies (`vcpkg.json`'s own
description says so), so `config-wasm-emscripten`'s toolchain file goes straight to Emscripten's own
`Emscripten.cmake` — see that toolchain file's own header for why going through vcpkg's community
`wasm32-emscripten` triplet would be pure cost for nothing this preset needs.

Verified against **Emscripten 6.0.6**. No version is pinned in the toolchain file itself (unlike the
Android NDK's explicit pin) — there is no CMake-side equivalent of `local.properties`' `sdk.dir` to
pin against yet; whatever `$EMSDK` resolves to is what gets used.

## Release / CI

The demo builds alongside the desktop packages rather than only ever being hand-built locally:
`.github/workflows/_build.yml`'s `build-wasm` job configures and builds it on every push, the same
continuous-smoke-test role `build-android`'s always-on debug APK plays — proving the Emscripten
toolchain and every file it touches still build. Like `build-android`, it's its own job rather than
a `build` matrix entry: this leg has no ctest suite, no cpack package and no gold-reference gate, so
folding it into that matrix would mean threading new `if:` exclusions through most of that job's
steps for no benefit.

**The published demo is rebuilt fresh, not shipped from a committed copy.** `docs/assets/wasm-decode-demo/`
is committed to the repo as a working fallback (so a plain local `mkdocs build` — or this repo's own
PR-time docs check — still has something to embed without anyone needing Emscripten installed just
to preview docs), but `.github/workflows/docs.yml`'s `deploy` job (push to `main` only) installs
Emscripten, rebuilds `apps/wasm/` from source, and overwrites that directory *before* `mkdocs
gh-deploy` runs — so what actually reaches the live site always reflects current source, never a
possibly-stale commit. Both jobs share one Emscripten install step,
`.github/actions/setup-emscripten` (pinned to the same version this page's Toolchain section names),
so the two never drift onto different SDK versions.

The committed fallback is not immune to going stale, though: nothing rewrites it except a human
manually re-copying `apps/wasm/`'s output, and `docs.yml`'s own `deploy` job overwrites its
working copy in a throwaway CI workspace rather than committing the refresh back. `docs.yml`'s
`build` job (the one every PR runs, `mkdocs build --strict`) therefore also byte-compares
`index.html`, `demo.js`, the two favicon files and `assets/demo.ec3` against their
`apps/wasm/` originals — the plain copies, not Emscripten output, so the check needs no
toolchain. `ac3forge_decode.js`/`ac3forge_decode.wasm` are genuine build artifacts with no
source-tree counterpart and are outside this check's scope; they only get refreshed by an actual
Emscripten rebuild.

`docs.yml`'s trigger `paths:` list includes `apps/wasm/**`, `CMakeLists.txt`,
`CMakePresets.json` and the WASM toolchain file specifically — without them, a source change there
would never trigger a redeploy at all, and the live demo would silently drift from what's in
`apps/wasm/`.

## What has and has not been verified

!!! note "Verified in a real browser"
    Both `cmake --preset config-wasm-emscripten` and the full desktop presets configure and build
    clean from the same source tree (confirmed repeatedly across this PR's history, including after
    merging in the then-current integration branch and #169's own branch directly). A real
    Chromium instance loading the built page — both standalone and embedded in the actual
    `mkdocs build --strict`-built docs site — genuinely decodes a bundled 8-second, 3-object Atmos-in-DD+ fixture
    (`E-AC-3, 48000 Hz, 6 ch (L, C, R, Ls, Rs, LFE), 3 Atmos object(s), 8.0s`, matching what was
    encoded), plays real audio with `AudioContext.currentTime` genuinely advancing, and paints a
    speaker-ring visualization driven by real, time-varying per-channel RMS (confirmed non-degenerate
    per channel, including a genuinely-silent LFE since nothing was routed to it) that changes with
    playback position and responds to the seek bar.

    **Object decode specifically**: the same object's decoded position genuinely differs between two
    different playback timestamps (confirmed by direct comparison, not just "the code ran") and the
    room-view canvas paints real, non-empty content from it. Each "Solo object N" button was confirmed
    to switch playback to a buffer that (a) sample-for-sample matches `tanh()` of that specific
    object's own `object_audio`, (b) differs from every other object's audio, and (c) differs from the
    bed downmix — not just "some audio plays," the *correct* isolated object's audio plays.

!!! note "Automated in CI (roadmap VX18a)"
    `apps/wasm/tests/` is a small Playwright harness `build-wasm` now runs on every push, right
    after the demo artifact upload: it serves the just-built `wasm_decode_demo/` directory,
    loads `index.html` in a real headless Chromium, and drives the `WasmDecoder` Embind API
    directly (the same calls `demo.js` makes) to decode the bundled fixture and assert on the
    real values the note above once had to be checked by eye — `E-AC-3, 48000 Hz, 6 channels, 3
    Atmos objects, 8.0s`, and that the same object's decoded position genuinely differs between
    its first and last frame. A regression in any of those numbers now fails CI rather than
    waiting for the next manual pass.

!!! warning "Not yet verified"
    Built and tested on a Windows host only — the toolchain file itself makes no Windows-specific
    assumption, and CI's `build-wasm`/`docs.yml` jobs both run on `ubuntu-latest`, but no macOS run
    has been attempted anywhere. The CI browser test above covers the decode itself, not the page
    around it: real audio playback (`AudioContext.currentTime` advancing), the speaker-ring and
    room-view visualizations, the seek bar, and the "Solo object N" buttons' own audio-isolation
    claim are still manual verification only, not a repeatable check.
