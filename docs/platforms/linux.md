# Linux

ac3forge builds and is tested on Linux today, on both GCC and Clang, CLI and GUI alike. This
page covers what is specific to Linux; for the full preset reference, options list and
troubleshooting, see [Building from source](../building.md).

## Toolchains

Built and tested with **GCC 16** and **Clang 22.1** on **Ubuntu 26.04 (WSL2)** — the versions
CI pins. Note that 26.04's own archive currently carries `gcc-16` as a pre-release/experimental
trunk snapshot in its `universe` component (`02-gcc-toolchain.sh` enables `universe` to reach
it) rather than the finished 16.1 release, which lands in a later Ubuntu series first — this is
Ubuntu's packaging timing, not a project choice, and the pin tracks whatever `apt` resolves for
`gcc-16` without further action needed here once 26.04 backports the stable release. The pin
itself is a CI reproducibility choice, not a hard floor of the code:
`cmake/toolchains/linux.{gcc,llvm}.toolchain.cmake` already `find_program` a fallback list
(`gcc-16, gcc, gcc-15, gcc-14, gcc-13` / `clang-22, clang, clang-21, clang-20`), so an older distro
compiler is picked up automatically — the [Raspberry Pi
validation](raspberry-pi.md#verified-configuration) built and passed the full suite with
GCC 14.2 and Clang 19.1.7.

`config-linux-gcc` and `config-linux-llvm` (each with a `-debug` variant) find the compiler by
that same known-name `find_program` walk, the same way the Windows presets pin MSVC/clang-cl,
rather than trusting whatever is first on `PATH`.

## Audio backend: ALSA, or PipeWire

On Linux, live capture (`ac3cli devices`/`record`), monitor playback (`ac3cli monitor`) and IEC
61937 bitstream passthrough (`ac3cli outputs`/`play`) are implemented over **ALSA** when its
headers are present, and over **PipeWire**'s native `pw_stream` API (not its ALSA-compatibility
shim) when they are not but PipeWire's are. Everything else is file I/O and needs no audio stack
at all — `ac3cli spdif` in particular reaches an AV receiver by writing a WAV, on any machine.

Both dependencies are optional, detected packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

(`alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora, `alsa-lib` on Arch), or

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpipewire-0.3-dev
```

(`pipewire-devel` on Fedora), or both — ALSA wins when both are present, see [Why ALSA still
comes first](#why-alsa-still-comes-first). No PulseAudio development headers, vcpkg port, or
runtime daemon are ever needed by either. Without either set of headers, configure succeeds
anyway and the build selects a no-backend fallback whose entry points return `kNoBackend`;
`ac3cli` marks the affected commands `UNAVAILABLE HERE` in its usage rather than pretending they
exist. `AC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA` and `AC3FORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE` both default to `AUTO` (build the one
that's found); set either to `ON` to make its own missing headers a configure error instead,
which is what a packaging build wants.

### Why ALSA still comes first

Capture and monitor playback are ordinary PCM, which every Linux audio API can do, and both
backends implement them for real. Passthrough is the discriminator, and it's what the whole
project is for. On Linux, a bitstream isn't a distinct "format" the way it is on Windows: it's
opened as plain 16-bit stereo PCM, and what tells the receiver these bytes are Dolby Digital
rather than music is the IEC 60958 **channel status** travelling beside them (the non-audio bit,
AES0 bit 1). ALSA is the layer where that bit is expressed, as arguments on the device name
(`iec958:CARD=PCH,DEV=0,AES0=0x06,…`), and it works unconditionally the moment compatible
hardware exists.

PipeWire has its own real, current, native mechanism for the same bit — `SPA_MEDIA_SUBTYPE_
iec958`, confirmed against a real shipped client (Kodi's own PipeWire passthrough support), not
assumed from memory. What it lacks is ALSA's "just works": a PipeWire sink only offers a
compressed codec once its `iec958Codecs` control has been populated by the session manager,
configuration this library cannot perform on a caller's behalf. That gap — not a capability gap
— is why ALSA keeps first precedence whenever both are found, rather than PipeWire winning by
default for being the modern norm on most current desktops. The full reasoning, and the explicit
override for a machine where PipeWire's compressed codecs genuinely are configured, is in [Why
ALSA still comes first](../building.md#why-alsa-still-comes-first).

### What has and has not been verified

!!! warning "No Linux audio has been tried against real hardware"
    Both backends were verified **headless only**, on WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04 with GCC 15.2 and Clang
    22.1: ALSA with libasound present and absent and under ASan+UBSan with leak detection;
    PipeWire (libpipewire-0.3 1.6.2) with the selection forced via `-DAC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF
    -DAC3FORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE=ON`, since WSL2's image has both sets of headers and ALSA wins by
    default. The full test suite passes in every configuration tried. ALSA's device-independent
    halves (device-name construction, channel-status derivation, negotiation, the render/capture
    threads, start/stop, error mapping) were additionally driven end to end against ALSA's
    software `null` PCM device. WSL2 has no sound devices, no kernel sound modules, and no
    PipeWire session running at all, so nothing on either backend has ever been bitstreamed to a
    real S/PDIF or HDMI output, no AV receiver has been asked to lock onto the result, and
    PipeWire's own enumeration has only ever seen "no session" (`pw_context_connect()` failing
    fast, not a real graph with real nodes) rather than a genuine node to negotiate a compressed
    format against. This is a real, current gap, not a minor caveat — whether a given output
    accepts a bitstream is per-device anyway, and `ac3cli outputs` probes each one and reports
    what it finds.

## GUI: opt-in, not on by default

Unlike Windows, where `AC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI` defaults **ON**, both Linux presets default it
**OFF** — not because the GUI can't be built on Linux (`cmake/FindQt6.cmake` resolves a Linux Qt
kit the same way it resolves a Windows one, and `ac3gui` builds clean and passes its headless
`--smoke` run under both Linux presets in CI), but because a Qt kit isn't assumed to be present
on every Linux machine that builds this project. Opt in explicitly once Qt 6.5+ is installed:

```bash
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-debug -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON
```

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools qt6-declarative-dev qt6-declarative-dev-tools
```

Other distros need the equivalent Qt6 base + declarative (QML/Quick) packages (Fedora:
`qt6-qtbase-devel` / `qt6-qtdeclarative-devel`). See [GUI on Linux](../building.md#gui-on-linux)
for the CMake warnings you'll see about unlinked QML plugins (harmless — a property of how
distro-packaged Qt6 is built, not a missing dependency).

## Building

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-debug
cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc-debug
ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-debug
```

Substitute `linux-llvm` for `linux-gcc` to build with Clang instead. Add
`-DAC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON` to either configure line to build `ac3gui` too, once Qt is installed
(see [GUI](#gui-opt-in-not-on-by-default) above). `VCPKG_ROOT` must point at a vcpkg checkout —
it supplies Catch2, plus Boost and Tracy only if you opt into the `adm`/`profiling` features
(see [building.md](../building.md)), same as on Windows; this project's own convention keeps it
at `/opt/vcpkg`, but any path works.

## Packaging

```bash
cpack --preset pack-linux-gcc
```

(or `pack-linux-llvm` for the Clang build; append `-arm64` for the arm64 presets). Produces a
plain tarball, plus DEB/RPM on top when the corresponding packaging tool is on `PATH`. A local
run packages whatever the tree was configured with — the GUI only if you opted in. Tagged
releases run `pack-linux-gcc` and `pack-linux-gcc-arm64` for real, and CI configures those legs
with `-DAC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON`, so released Linux packages include `ac3gui`; a real arm64 `.deb`
has also been produced and inspected on Raspberry Pi hardware (see
[Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md#verified-configuration)). See
[Packaging](../building.md#packaging).

## CI

`linux-gcc` and `linux-llvm` both run on every push and are **required**; both install a Qt6 kit
and build and smoke-test `ac3gui` in addition to the CLI. A third leg, `linux-llvm-asan-ubsan`
(AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer), is also required but stays **CLI-only on
purpose**, to keep a Qt kit out of the sanitizer leg's install time.

Two more legs, `linux-gcc-arm64` and `linux-llvm-arm64`, run the same matrix on real ARM hardware
(GitHub's `ubuntu-24.04-arm` hosted runner, not QEMU emulation) — see
[Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md), which is the hardware this arch target is validated
against.

The ALSA backend adds 14 tests of its own (`tests/backend/alsa/`) on top of the base suite: a
Linux build with the GUI on and `libasound2-dev` absent runs the same suite as Windows, and ALSA
adds those 14. `ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-debug` (or whichever preset matches your build)
runs the full suite. See [Verified configuration](../building.md#verified-configuration)
for the full CI matrix.
