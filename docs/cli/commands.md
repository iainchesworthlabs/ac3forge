## By category

### Synthesis — generate a stream from nothing

No source file needed; useful for smoke-testing a build or a receiver without recording
anything first.

| Command | What it writes |
|---|---|
| `silence` | Silent AC-3 |
| `sine` | A tone, one per speaker, AC-3. Append `c` to `[layout]` (e.g. `stereoc`) to turn on channel coupling. |
| `orbit` | AC-3 with a synthetic panned source circling the room (exercises the [spatial layer](../library/spatial-and-atmos.md) — plain bed panning, no object metadata) |
| `atmos` | E-AC-3 with synthetic orbiting Atmos objects — a 5.1 bed plus JOC + OAMD side data (TS 103 420) |
| `atmos-path` | Same, but object motion comes from an authored keyframe file instead of the built-in orbit |

The keyframe file `atmos-path` reads (and `atmos-encode`'s optional `[paths.txt]`, below) is
plain text, one keyframe per line as whitespace-separated columns
`object_index time_s x y z gain lfe_send`; `#` starts a comment and blank lines are skipped.
It is the same grammar the GUI's timeline exports — see
[GUI → Objects & motion](../gui/objects-and-motion.md).

```bash
ac3cli eac3-sine out.ec3 5 384 1000 50 714
```

Five seconds at 50% amplitude, 384 kbps, one tone per coded channel — 14 of them for a 7.1.4
layout, though only 12 reach speakers: the two bed channels the dependent substreams replace
carry tones a full decoder never renders. (The 1000 Hz argument applies only to a one- or
two-channel layout; anything wider gets a distinct spread of per-channel frequencies instead,
so a misrouted channel is identifiable by ear.)

### File encoding — real audio in, a stream out

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `encode` | WAV → AC-3. Without `[layout]`, follows the source channel count (1→mono, 2→stereo, 3–6→5.1); a wider source is refused, since no AC-3 coding mode is wider than 3/2 + LFE. |
| `eac3-encode` | WAV → E-AC-3, with the Annex E `tools:` token and an optional `vbr:` token available (see [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md)). Without `[layout]`, follows the source channel count (1→mono, 2→stereo, 3–6→5.1, 8→7.1, 10→5.1.4, 12→7.1.4). |
| `atmos-encode` | WAV → E-AC-3 Atmos, every source channel becomes its own object; optional `[paths.txt]` drives per-object motion from an authored keyframe file the same way `atmos-path` does, keyed by WAV channel index — an object it doesn't mention keeps its default (fanned-out) placement |

```bash
ac3cli encode in.wav out.ac3 448 couple
```

448 kbps, channel coupling on, layout inferred from the WAV's channel count.

`1+1` (dual mono — two independent programmes, never inferred from a channel count, so it always
has to be named explicitly) takes its two channels either as one two-channel file or as two mono
ones:

```bash
ac3cli encode both.wav out.ac3 192 1+1                    # Ch1/Ch2 = channels 0/1 of both.wav
ac3cli encode narration_en.wav out.ac3 192 1+1 narration_fr.wav  # Ch1, Ch2 as separate files
```

See [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) for `dialnorm2=` — Ch2's own dialnorm, alongside
the usual `dialnorm=`.

`encode`, `eac3-encode` and `atmos-encode` all take `-` in place of `<in.wav>` or the output path
to mean stdin or stdout, so a pipeline never has to touch a temporary file:

```bash
ac3cli encode - - 448 couple < in.wav > out.ac3
```

The status text these commands normally print (frame count, routing, per-channel levels,
`dialnorm=auto`'s measurement line) goes to stderr instead of stdout whenever the output side is
`-`, so it never ends up inside the piped stream — `src=`/`map=` multi-source runs included.

### ADM ingest — real professional master files (opt-in, roadmap B1)

**Only *runnable* in a build with `-DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`** — but always *listed*, the same
"a command a build cannot run is shown, not hidden" treatment the live-audio commands below get
(see that section's own note): a default build's usage block at the top of this page shows this
row as `UNAVAILABLE HERE` instead of the description below, and running it prints a clear reason
(`ac3cli atmos-adm ...` → `error: 'atmos-adm' is unavailable on this platform: this build was not
configured with -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON ...`) rather than "unknown command". Every command besides
this one builds and works identically whether that flag is on or off — this is the one exception,
because it is the one command that needs `ac3adm::ac3adm`/`ac3::admbridge`, this project's sole
opt-in, Boost-requiring module (default **off** — see
[ADM / BW64 reading](../library/adm.md#why-opt-in)). What the row looks like in a build configured
with the flag on (the usage block at the top of this page is copied from a *default* build, where
this row instead reads `UNAVAILABLE HERE`):

```text
  ac3cli atmos-adm    <in.adm.wav> <out.ec3> [bitrate_kbps] [programme_id] (a real ADM BWF master (BS.2076-2 ADM XML + BW64/RF64, roadmap B1) straight to DD+ JOC E-AC-3; every bed/object channel the resolved audioProgramme names becomes an AtmosEncoder object, driven by the file's own authored automation - no keyframe file needed. Only in builds with -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON)
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `atmos-adm` | A real ADM BWF master (professional delivery format Netflix's and Apple's own Atmos ingest pipelines require) straight to DD+ JOC E-AC-3 — no WAV, no hand-authored keyframe file: [`ac3::admbridge::build`](../library/adm-bridge.md) classifies every channel as a bed speaker feed or a dynamic object and builds its own `ac3::oba::ObjectPath` straight from the file's authored BS.2076-2 §10.3 position/gain automation, driven frame by frame the same way `atmos-encode` drives an authored `[paths.txt]` |

```bash
ac3cli atmos-adm master.wav out.ec3 448
```

448 kbps, the file's lowest-ID `audioProgramme` (BS.2076-2 §5.8's own default-selection rule).
Pass a fourth argument to pick a different one by ID:

```bash
ac3cli atmos-adm master.wav out.ec3 448 APR_1002
```

`dialnorm=` works the same as every other encoding command (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md)); `dialnorm=auto` does not — an ADM document's bed/object
channels have no single fixed layout to measure loudness against the way `atmos-encode`'s WAV
input does, so `atmos-adm` refuses it with a clear error rather than silently keeping the default.

Every failure — a container/XML parse error (`ac3adm::AdmError`) or a graph-resolution error
(`ac3::admbridge::BridgeError`, e.g. no `audioProgramme`, an unresolved reference, an unsupported
pack type) — prints a real diagnosis via that error's own `describe()`, never an opaque crash or a
bare non-zero exit.

See [ADM / BW64 reading](../library/adm.md) and [ADM → Atmos bridging](../library/adm-bridge.md)
for the parser and the mapping layer this command drives, and
[`examples/encode_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/encode_adm.cpp)
for the same pipeline as a minimal, standalone, self-fixturing program.

### Object-layer strip

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `strip-objects` | Takes the JOC/OAMD object layer **out** of a Dolby Digital Plus stream without decoding it, leaving a plain DD+ 5.1 stream whose bed audio is bit-identical |

```bash
ac3cli strip-objects atmos.ec3 bed51.ec3
```

```text
stripped 63 of 63 frame(s) in atmos.ec3 -> bed51.ec3 (7032 bytes removed, 105864 left)
  3/2 + LFE at 48000 Hz, no object metadata remains
```

JOC's bed is the full mix — every object is already panned into it, which is what makes an
Atmos DD+ stream play on an Atmos-unaware decoder at all. So the 5.1 rendition of a JOC stream
needs no re-encode, only the object layer removed: the EMDF container in the per-block skip
fields and TS 103 420 §8.3.1's `addbsi` marker come out, `frmsiz` and `crc2` are re-derived
around what is left, and every exponent and mantissa is copied bit for bit. Decoding the result
gives sample-identical PCM. See [Object-layer strip](../library/decoding.md#object-layer-strip)
for what it does and does not touch.

The container is removed, not emptied — an empty container would still tell every downstream
signalling path (`dec3`'s Atmos extension, an HLS `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` attribute) that objects
are present. The same goes for the `addbsi` marker on its own: a stream that signals objects it
does not carry gets that signalling removed too. A stream with no object layer at all is copied
through unchanged; an AC-3 stream is refused, since Annex E is where skip fields and substreams
live.

Rewritten frames are sized to their real content, so the output is smaller than the input and a
constant-rate input does not stay constant-rate — the encoder's rate-filling auxdata padding
goes along with the container. The reported byte count says how much.

This is what `fmp4 … fallback-51` uses to write the paired 5.1 rendition Apple's HLS authoring
requirements ask for beside an Atmos one.

### Decoding & inspection

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `decode` | AC-3 or E-AC-3 → WAV; `bsid` in the stream decides which decoder runs. For an Atmos E-AC-3 stream, reports the object count found and, with `objects_dir`, exports each JOC-reconstructed object as its own `object_NN.wav` there |
| `levels` | Per-channel peak/RMS report — takes a WAV or an encoded stream |
| `loudness` | BS.1770-4 gated loudness on a WAV, reported as the `dialnorm` it implies |
| `qc` | Bitstream-aware loudness QC: decodes an already-encoded AC-3/E-AC-3 stream, measures it with the real BS.1770-4/EBU Tech 3342 meter, and compares the result against the stream's own embedded `dialnorm`/`compr` and, optionally, a named delivery-spec gate |

```bash
ac3cli decode out.ec3 out.wav
```

`decode` takes `-` for either path too, the same convention the encoding commands above use:

```bash
ac3cli decode - - < out.ac3 > out.wav
```

It decodes on the fast (FFT) inverse-transform path by default; `mode=reference` or
`fast-imdct=off` selects the spec's direct evaluation instead — see
[Validation → Performance and reference modes](../verification.md#performance-and-reference-modes)
for what each mode is for, and [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) for the token rules.

For an Atmos stream, add `objects_dir` to also export each object's reconstructed audio:

```bash
ac3cli decode atmos.ec3 bed.wav objects/
```

`qc` is `loudness`'s bitstream-aware counterpart: `loudness` measures a *source* WAV before encoding, `qc` measures what a stream actually *delivers* after encoding and decoding it back, and checks that against what the stream's own metadata claims:

```bash
ac3cli qc programme.ec3
```

```text
qc: programme.ec3 (E-AC-3, 3/2 + LFE, 48000 Hz, 938 access unit(s), 30.02 s)
measured (BS.1770-4 gated / EBU Tech 3342 / BS.1770-4 Annex 2):
  integrated loudness    -22.87 LKFS
  loudness range          4.31 LU
  true peak               -1.62 dBTP
embedded metadata:
  dialnorm              24  (claims dialogue at -24.00 LKFS)
  compr                absent
dialnorm check:
  claimed                -24.00 LKFS  (from dialnorm 24)
  delta                   +1.13 dB    (measured - claimed; positive = measured is louder)
  measurement-derived dialnorm would be 23, not 24
```

Add `preset=<name>` (or `preset=all`) to gate that same measurement against a named delivery spec instead of just reporting it — see [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#qc-options-qc-preset) for the exact preset numbers and the primary source cited for each, and this page's own exit-code note below.

`qc`'s exit code is 0 only when the file decodes cleanly **and** (if a preset was given) every requested gate passes — non-zero otherwise, which is what makes it usable as an actual CI/pipeline QC step: `ac3cli qc out.ec3 preset=ebu-r128-s2 || echo "loudness QC failed"`. With no `preset=` at all it only ever measures and reports (no verdict to fail), so a plain `ac3cli qc <file>` exits non-zero solely on a genuine decode error.

### Containers

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `spdif` | Wraps AC-3 or E-AC-3 as IEC 61937 bursts inside a playable PCM16 WAV — `bsid` in the stream decides which, and the E-AC-3 carrier runs at four times the content sample rate. For feeding a receiver through an ordinary audio path |
| `mkv` | Wraps AC-3 or E-AC-3 as Matroska, reading format/packet boundaries/sample rate/channel count from the bitstream itself so the container can't be told the wrong ones |
| `mp4` | Wraps AC-3 or E-AC-3 as a single-file MP4/ISOBMFF, writing a spec-correct `dac3`/`dec3` sample-entry box (fscod/bsid/bsmod/acmod/lfeon, plus the Atmos complexity-index extension for JOC content) read straight off the bitstream |
| `ts` | Wraps AC-3 or E-AC-3 as an MPEG-2 Transport Stream (PAT + PMT + one PES-wrapped audio PID), identified per whichever broadcast profile the optional third argument names — `dvb` (the default) or `atsc`. See below |
| `fmp4` | Writes fragmented MP4/CMAF — an init segment plus one media segment per fragment — alongside an HLS media+master playlist pair and a DASH MPD, all pointing at the same segments, ready for a real HLS/DASH origin or packager. `[frames_per_fragment]` defaults to 48 access units per fragment, about 1.5 s at 48 kHz. Atmos content signals `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` in the HLS playlists automatically, and `fallback-51` additionally writes the paired 5.1 rendition |

#### `ts` broadcast profiles

ATSC and DVB both register AC-3/E-AC-3 for MPEG-TS carriage, with different, non-interoperable
signalling — so a stream satisfies one of them, never a bit of each:

```bash
ac3cli ts programme.ec3 programme.ts atsc
```

| | `dvb` (default) | `atsc` |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 `stream_type` | `0x06` (PES private data) | `0x81` (A/52 Annex A §A4.1) |
| E-AC-3 `stream_type` | `0x06` | `0x87` (A/52 Annex G §G3.1) |
| AC-3 descriptor | `AC3_descriptor`, tag `0x6A` (ETSI EN 300 468 Table D.6) | `AC-3_audio_stream_descriptor`, tag `0x81` (A/52 Table A4.1) |
| E-AC-3 descriptor | `enhanced_AC-3_descriptor`, tag `0x7A` (Table D.7) | `E-AC-3_audio_descriptor`, tag `0xCC` (A/52 Table G.1) |

Either way the descriptor's identification fields are read off the bitstream, not guessed: the
service type (`bsmod`), the channel mode and rendered channel count, the surround mode
(`dsurmod`), `bsid`, whether mixing metadata is present, and which independent substreams the
stream uses. Two values are not in any bitstream, because they describe how services in a
multiplex *relate* rather than what one stream contains, so they are omitted unless given:

| Option | What it says |
|---|---|
| `mainid=<0-7>` | The main-service number this service is, or that an associated service points at |
| `asvc=<mask>` | Which main services an **associated** service may be reproduced with, one bit each — decimal or `0xNN` |

```bash
ac3cli ts commentary.ac3 commentary.ts atsc asvc=0x05
```

### Live & hardware

Needs the platform's capture/passthrough backend — see the per-OS Platform notes pages
([Windows](../platforms/windows.md), [Linux](../platforms/linux.md),
[Raspberry Pi](../platforms/raspberry-pi.md), [macOS](../platforms/macos.md),
[Android](../platforms/android.md)) for what's actually confirmed against real hardware on
each OS.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `devices` | Lists capture endpoints (microphones, playback-device loopbacks) |
| `outputs` | Lists render endpoints and whether each supports AC-3/E-AC-3 passthrough |
| `record` | Captures from a device straight to an AC-3 file, metering live — `container=mkv` writes straight to Matroska instead |
| `play` | Exclusive-mode IEC 61937 passthrough of an existing file — `bsid` decides AC-3 vs. E-AC-3 |
| `monitor` | Decodes an existing file and plays it on an ordinary, non-bitstreamed output — the shared-mode preview path. For an Atmos-mode stream, this plays the 5.1 **bed** and reports the object count found: the decoder reads TS 103 420's object layer (OAMD/JOC) but this path does not render or export objects, so this is what a legacy decoder hears, not unmixed objects — use `decode` with `objects_dir` for the object audio itself. |
| `live` | Capture → encode → optional live monitor and/or IEC 61937 passthrough, running continuously, still writing the file `record` always has; optionally a second, clock-conformed capture device via `capture2=`, or straight to Matroska via `container=mkv` |

`live`'s device arguments: `monitor_device`/`passthrough_device` take `-2` (default, leaves that
leg off), `-1` (the default render endpoint), or an index from `outputs`. Either or both legs may
run alongside the file `live` always writes.

`live mode` (also shared with `atmos`): `channels` (default) carries stereo straight through;
`atmos` pans every captured channel into a 5.1 bed as its own object, moving it every frame the
same way `atmos`'s synthetic orbit does — the hook a real live position source drops into once
one exists.

`live capture2=<index>`: the `capture_device` positional stays the session's clock master, paced
exactly as it always has been; `capture2=` adds a second, independently-clocked device (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#live-options-live-capture2) for the full grammar) whose
stream is resampled to track the master, with the measured drift printed at session end.

positional arguments (and which commands ignore which), plus the full `layout`, `tools` and
`vbr` grammars.
