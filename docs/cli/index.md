# ac3cli

`ac3cli` is the command-line front end over `ac3::forge` — thirty-nine commands covering
synthesis, file encoding/decoding, container wrapping, inspection, live capture/playback, and the
tool's own self-description (`help`, `man`, `completions`).
One of the thirty-nine (`atmos-adm`) only *runs* in a build configured with
`-DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`, but is always *listed* — the same "shown, not hidden" treatment
this page's own live-audio commands get when the platform can't run them either (see
[Commands](commands.md)'s own ADM section). Every command it can run is backed by the same public
library documented under [Library](../library/index.md); every codec and format decision lives in
the library, and the CLI keeps only small local helpers of its own (the DASH MPD document wrapper
`fmp4` writes; the scene files behind `atmos-path`/`atmos-encode` are parsed by the library's
own `ac3::oba::read_scene`).

Run it with no arguments for the full usage text — the command list in [Commands](commands.md)
is transcribed from it, and re-checked against a built binary at each release.

```bash
ac3cli
```

## Installing

Building from source ([Quick start](../quickstart.md)) always works. Three shorter paths are
staged but not live yet — each is pending submission to its registry, so use the local form
shown until then (see [Releasing](../releasing.md) for the per-tool submission status):

- **winget** (Windows) — once
  [`packaging/winget/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/tree/main/packaging/winget)
  is merged into `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, `winget install iainchesworthlabs.ac3forge` installs
  `ac3cli` and `ac3gui` together as portable executables. Today, `winget install --manifest
  packaging/winget/manifests/i/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/<version>` from a clone does the same.
- **Homebrew** (macOS/Linux) — once
  [`packaging/homebrew/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/tree/main/packaging/homebrew)
  is published to a personal tap, `brew install iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/ac3forge` installs
  `ac3cli` (GUI not packaged there — see that page). Today, `brew install --build-from-source
  ./packaging/homebrew/Formula/ac3forge.rb` from a clone builds the same formula locally.
- **A prebuilt archive** — every [release](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/releases)
  already publishes a `.zip`/`.tar.gz`/`.dmg` per platform with `ac3cli` (and `ac3gui` where
  built) inside, no package manager or local clone needed — see [What gets
  published](../releasing.md#what-gets-published).

## Version

```bash
ac3cli --version
```

Prints the semantic version plus git provenance — commit, branch, and a dirty flag. The version
itself is derived from the nearest reachable `v*` git tag at configure time, so it tracks the
latest release tag (see [Releasing](../releasing.md) and `cmake/GitVersionDerivation.cmake`);
the rest is stamped in at build time by `cmake/GenerateVersion.cmake`:

```
ac3forge 0.5.0-beta.1
  release: v0.5.0-beta.1
  commit:  971a547390ff21560e370fb5cb2a22ef362f75de
  branch:  main
  target:  Windows x86_64 (MSVC 1951)
```

A build from past the tag says so in the headline, as semver build metadata: `ac3forge
0.10.0-beta.1+100` is a hundred commits past `v0.10.0-beta.1` (the `release:` line carries
git's own describe of it), so it is not mistaken for the tagged release. A tree with
uncommitted changes adds a `state: dirty` line.

`--version` (or its `-v` alias) is a flag, not one of the thirty-nine commands — it's handled
before argument parsing and exits immediately. So are `--help` and `-h`, which print the named
command's own help (or the full listing when no command was named).

## Conventions shared across commands

- **Layouts** (`mono | stereo | 1+1 | 51 | 71 | 512 | 514 | 714`) name a channel bed by
  ear-friendly shorthand. AC-3 only reaches `mono | stereo | 1+1 | 51`; anything wider needs
  the dependent substreams that only E-AC-3 has. A layout can also be a comma-separated
  [Table E2.5](../library/channel-plans-and-routing.md) location list
  (e.g. `L,C,R,LFE,Vhl,Vhr`) for a channel set none of the named layouts cover — AC-3 accepts
  one too, as long as it needs no dependent substream — see
  [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) for the full grammar.
- **`out.ac3` vs. `out.ec3`** is how commands tell AC-3 output from E-AC-3 output; extensions
  aren't enforced, they're just the convention the examples follow.
- **`-` means stdin or stdout** for `encode`, `eac3-encode`, `atmos-encode`, `decode`,
  `strip-objects`, `probe` and `unspdif`'s WAV/AC-3/E-AC-3 path arguments — the conventional Unix
  pipe convention, so a WAV or stream never needs to touch a disk at all:

  ```bash
  ac3cli encode - - 448 couple < in.wav > out.ac3
  ac3cli decode - - < out.ac3 > out.wav
  ```

  Everything else about the command is unchanged; only the argument's meaning changes from "open
  this path" to "use the standard stream instead". Windows needs no special handling on the
  caller's part — ac3cli puts stdin/stdout into binary mode itself before the first byte crosses
  either one.
- **Metadata options** (`drc=`, `heavy`, `dialnorm=`, `cmixlev=`, …) can follow the positional
  arguments of any encoding command, in any order — see
  [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md), including which commands ignore which options.
- **PCM-carrying commands report per-channel peak/RMS levels when they finish**; `record` meters
  live. With `-` as the output path, every encode and decode path sends that report (and the rest
  of its status text — `dialnorm=auto`'s measurement line and the `src=`/`map=` multi-source
  paths' summary/routing/levels report included) to stderr, so it never lands in the middle of
  the piped stream.
- **Exit codes are documented and distinct**: `0` success, `1` usage, `2` input, `3` output,
  `4` unavailable here, `5` runtime, `6` a failed QC gate, `7` internal. `ac3cli help exit-codes`
  prints the table; [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#exit-codes) explains each.
- **`quiet` and `verbose`** follow the positional arguments of any command: `quiet` silences the
  status output (never the errors, never a reporting command's report, never a `-` payload), and
  `verbose` turns on the stderr progress line whatever the run's length.
- **`help <command>`, `--help` and `-h`** print one command's own row and the grammars it uses;
  `man` and `completions <shell>` print a generated man page and shell completion script, all
  four rendered from the same command table so none of them can drift from what dispatch accepts.
- **Commands needing audio hardware** (`devices`, `record`, `monitor`, `live`, `outputs`, `play`)
  report themselves unavailable on a build with no capture/passthrough backend, rather than
  failing to link — see the per-OS Platform notes pages ([Windows](../platforms/windows.md),
  [Linux](../platforms/linux.md), [Raspberry Pi](../platforms/raspberry-pi.md),
  [macOS](../platforms/macos.md), [Android](../platforms/android.md)) for what's actually
  hardware-confirmed on each OS.
- **`play` follows the sink** (roadmap UX9): given a `device_index`, it reads that endpoint's own
  advertised capabilities before committing to a format. That read is itself backend-specific —
  real today only on ALSA, a live probe everywhere else, same per-OS pages above — see
  [Commands → Following the sink](commands.md#following-the-sink).

## Next

- [Commands](commands.md) — all 39 commands, grouped and with real usage text (`atmos-adm` only
  *runs* with `-DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`, but is listed either way), plus the exit-code table.
- [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) — the `drc=`/`heavy`/`dialnorm=`/… options grammar,
  the `tools` argument grammar, and the full layout/location-list grammar.
- [Concepts](../concepts/index.md) — if `bsid`, `syncframe`, or `JOC` aren't already familiar.
