# Spatial & Atmos objects

## The spatial object layer

`ac3/spatial/spatial.hpp`. Mono sources placed on the ITU-R BS.775 ring, rendered to a 5.1
bed. This is the plain-AC-3 object path: the output is an ordinary 5.1 stream and *nothing
survives about where the object was*.

```cpp
ac3::spatial::BedRenderer renderer;
// add_object allocates, so call it before rendering starts.
const std::size_t object = renderer.add_object({.azimuth_deg = 0.0, .gain = 0.7});
```

Rendering is clocked at the 256-sample block, because that is the rate automation runs at;
gains ramp linearly within a block, so moving an object does not click. The render path itself
does not allocate.

```cpp
// One full turn every two seconds.
renderer.set_target(object, {.azimuth_deg = 180.0 * seconds, .gain = 0.7});

// Six writable 256-sample spans into this block of the frame:
// L, C, R, SL, SR, LFE. render_block overwrites them.
std::array<std::span<float>, 6> block_out{};
for (std::size_t ch = 0; ch < 6; ++ch) {
    block_out[ch] = std::span<float>{bed[ch]}.subspan(
        static_cast<std::size_t>(block * ac3::spatial::kBlockSamples),
        ac3::spatial::kBlockSamples);
}
const std::array<std::span<const float>, 1> audio{std::span<const float>{source}};
renderer.render_block(audio, block_out);
```

Full program: [`examples/spatial_objects.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/spatial_objects.cpp).

`pan_azimuth(deg)` and `pan_room(x, y)` expose the panner directly if you want the gains
without the renderer. Both are energy-normalized pairwise (VBAP on the horizontal ring),
Σg² = 1.

There is no `z`. A 5.1 ring has no height speakers, so a raised source folds onto the ring at
its azimuth, at full level. Objects never reach the LFE by panning — `lfe_send` is the only
route.

## Objects with metadata: `ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`

`ac3/oba/atmos.hpp`. The same objects, but their positions survive: the output is one ordinary
5.1 E-AC-3 stream with OAMD and JOC payloads riding beside it in an EMDF container
(TS 102 366 Annex H, carried in a block skip field). A decoder that knows about neither plays
the bed unchanged, at full level — that is the design target, not a fallback.

```cpp
constexpr int kObjects = 3;
// Object metadata competes with the mantissas for the same frame, so an
// object stream wants more headroom than a plain 5.1 one.
ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder encoder{{.bitrate_kbps = 448}, kObjects};
```

```cpp
// Positions are room-anchored per §4.2.1: x 0 at the left wall to 1 at
// the right, y 0 front to 1 back, z -1 at the floor to +1 at the
// ceiling (0 is listener height).
std::array<ac3::oba::ObjectPlacement, kObjects> placement{};
placement[obj] = {
    .position = {.x = 0.5 + 0.45 * std::cos(angle),
                 .y = 0.5 + 0.45 * std::sin(angle),
                 .z = 0.25 * static_cast<double>(obj)},
    .gain = 1.0,
};

const auto unit = encoder.encode_frame(views, placement);
```

### Extent and rendering constraints

An object is not necessarily a point. `ObjectPlacement` also carries TS 103 420 §5.6.1's
extent and rendering-constraint fields, all of which reach OAMD:

```cpp
placement[obj] = {
    .position = {.x = 0.5, .y = 0.2, .z = 0.4},
    .gain = 1.0,
    // §5.6.1.2 Table 17, each axis in [0, 1]. Table 17 has three shapes and
    // only three: a point source, one value shared by all three axes, and
    // three separate ones - build_payload picks the cheapest that fits.
    .size = {.width = 0.4, .depth = 0.1, .height = 0.4},
    // §5.6.1.5.1 b_object_snap - what ADM calls channelLock: render to the
    // nearest speaker instead of panning between speakers.
    .snap = false,
    // §5.6.1.6 Table 20/21: which horizontal zones the renderer may use,
    // and whether the Top-Bottom zone is in play at all.
    .zone = ac3::oba::ZoneConstraint::kScreenOnly,
    .enable_elevation = true,
};
```

These are **transmitted, not rendered here**. §4.3 makes the renderer, not the decoder,
responsible for turning an extent into loudspeaker feeds, and the 5.1 downmix this encoder
builds is a point-source VBAP pan by construction — a downmix that spread the object would
then be spread *again* by the receiving renderer. So a sized object is transmitted as sized and
folded into the bed as a point, which is the honest split.

`Keyframe` carries the same four fields. `size` interpolates between keyframes the way position
and gain do (BS.2076-2 §10.3 lists width/height/depth among its interpolatable parameters);
`snap`, `zone` and `enable_elevation` do not — they are discrete decisions with no meaningful
halfway point, so `evaluate()` holds the earlier keyframe's value until the later one is reached.

| `AtmosConfig` | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bitrate_kbps` | 448 | Per substream, as everywhere else. |
| `num_bands_idx` | 4 | Index into `joc::kNumBands` (Table 50). More bands cost codewords without giving the matrix anything new to say. |
| `fine_quant` | `false` | §6.3.3.7's half-step quantizer, roughly one more bit per coefficient. Worth it when objects are nearly degenerate. |
| `fast_mdct` | `true` | The §7.9.4 fast forward MDCT for the whole object encode: the bed's substream (via `eac3::FrameConfig::fast_mdct`) **and** the per-object `band_energy` transforms feeding the reconstruction-matrix solve. `false` forces the direct §8.2.3.2 reference form everywhere, for validation — the CLI spells that `fast-mdct=off` on the `atmos*` commands. |

At most 16 objects (`joc::kMaxObjects`, per TS 103 420 §8.3.2.2). `encoder.bed()` returns the
5.1 bed the last frame encoded — what a legacy decoder hears, and the thing most worth
checking — and `encoder.parameters()` the pre-quantization reconstruction matrix.

The matrix is the minimum mean-square estimate `M = P Dᵀ (D P Dᵀ + εI)⁻¹`. Because the encoder
built the downmix it knows `D` exactly rather than estimating it, which makes the solve
near-exact for well-separated objects. Two limits are structural, not bugs: objects sharing a
direction cannot be separated by any linear combination of the bed, and Dolby's decoder will
not treat these as objects at all. Both are covered in
[Atmos & JOC](../concepts/atmos-joc.md#two-honest-limitations).

## Scripted motion: `ac3::oba::motion`

`ac3/oba/motion.hpp`. `AtmosEncoder::encode_frame` always took a fresh `ObjectPlacement` per
call; what this adds is a shared way to say *where* an object is at a given moment, so a caller
stops reimplementing that per-frame math independently the way `atmos_objects.cpp` does.

```cpp
// A closed-form orbit - evaluated exactly rather than decimated into
// keyframes, so it stays an exact circle.
const auto orbit = ac3::oba::make_orbit_path(/*rate_hz=*/0.5, /*phase_rad=*/0.0,
                                             /*height=*/0.5, /*gain=*/0.6, /*lfe_send=*/0.0);

// Sparse authored points, linearly interpolated between neighbours and held
// at the ends rather than extrapolated.
auto keyframed = ac3::oba::KeyframePath::create({
    {.time_s = 0.0, .position = {.x = 0.0, .y = 0.5, .z = 0.0}, .gain = 0.0},
    {.time_s = 0.8, .position = {.x = 0.5, .y = 0.9, .z = 0.0}, .gain = 0.8},
    {.time_s = 1.6, .position = {.x = 1.0, .y = 0.5, .z = 0.0}, .gain = 0.0},
});
```

```cpp
// One call per frame gets every object's placement at that instant, in
// path order - exactly the span encode_frame() wants.
const auto placement = ac3::oba::evaluate_placements(paths, seconds);
const auto unit = encoder.encode_frame(views, placement);
```

Full program: [`examples/scripted_object_motion.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/scripted_object_motion.cpp).

`ObjectPath` is a `std::variant` of the two kinds behind one `evaluate(time_s)` interface, so a
caller (CLI, GUI) doesn't need to know which one it holds. This layer is scoped to
authored/batch motion — `evaluate(time_s)` is deliberately time-based so a future live-driven
cursor could reuse it, but that plumbing isn't built here. It backs `ac3cli atmos-path` and
`live`'s `atmos` mode, and the [station broadcast](station-broadcast.md) scene's ten authored
object paths.

## Objects-or-nothing: `AtmosConfig::emit_object_metadata`

Whether to emit the EMDF object container (OAMD + JOC) at all. On by default: an object-aware
decoder gets the objects, and one that ignores the container plays the 5.1 bed underneath it —
the design target. Turning it off is the *only* way to keep the bed playable on a decoder that
**validates** `emdf_protection` (see [Object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md)): such a
decoder treats the container's sync word as a commitment to object decoding and refuses the
whole stream if the tag doesn't check out, rather than falling back. With no container there is
no sync word to find, so it decodes the bed as ordinary 5.1. The choice is objects-or-nothing,
never both.

```cpp
ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder encoder{{.bitrate_kbps = 448, .emit_object_metadata = false}, kObjects};
```

Full program: [`examples/atmos_fallback.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/atmos_fallback.cpp)
— encodes the same objects both ways and confirms both decode as an ordinary 5.1 bed.

The stream size is unaffected either way — this is CBR, so `frmsiz` follows `bitrate_kbps`
regardless of what rides in the skip field. What differs is where those bits *go*: with the
container left out, the frame's rate control gives the freed skip-field bytes back to the
mantissas, so the two configurations' decoded bed is close but not bit-identical.
