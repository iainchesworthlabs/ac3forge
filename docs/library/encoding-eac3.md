# Encoding E-AC-3

## E-AC-3: `ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder`

`ac3/encoder/eac3_frame.hpp`. Same shape, different container. E-AC-3 is not an AC-3 variant:
no `crc1`, an arbitrary 11-bit `frmsiz` instead of a size table (so the 44.1 kHz padding
alternation disappears), and exponent strategies for all six blocks hoisted into a frame-level
`audfrm`.

```cpp
// Heap-allocated: FrameEncoder carries several KB of MDCT scratch/history
// state (PREfast's C6262).
auto encoder = std::make_unique<ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder>(ac3::eac3::FrameConfig{
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,
    .acmod = ac3::Acmod::k2_0,
});

std::vector<std::vector<float>> pcm(2, std::vector<float>(ac3::kSamplesPerFrame));
const auto views = views_of(pcm);

std::vector<std::byte> stream;
for (int frame = 0; frame < 31; ++frame) {
    fill_tones(pcm, tones, frame, 48000.0);
    const auto encoded = encoder->encode_frame(views);
    if (!encoded) {
        return 1;
    }
    stream.insert(stream.end(), encoded->begin(), encoded->end());
}
```

`FrameConfig` carries nearly everything `EncoderConfig` does, plus the Annex E tools. Two AC-3
fields do not carry over as-is: there is no `cplendf` — the coupling end frequency is derived
(the top of the coded spectrum, or from `spxbegf` when spectral extension is on, §E3.3.1) —
and `chbwcod` defaults to a fixed 60 rather than AC-3's auto-from-bitrate −1.

One field widens instead: `FrameConfig::sample_rate` also accepts the three Annex E half rates —
`k24000`, `k22050`, `k16000` (24/22.05/16 kHz). For those the encoder writes `fscod2` in place
of `numblkscod` (§E2.3.1.3, the block count is then implicitly six), and the reduced rate reuses
its double-rate parent's bit-allocation tables (§E2.3.1.4). The CLI maps the plain rate numbers
onto them. Classic AC-3 has no `frmsizecod` row for a reduced rate, so `ac3::FrameEncoder`
rejects them outright.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `spx`, `spxbegf` | `false`, -1 | Spectral extension (§E3.6). Above the extension frequency nothing is coded: the decoder copies a lower band up, blends noise, and scales to a transmitted envelope. Cheaper and cruder than coupling, so the two stack. |
| `spx_atten`, `spxattencod` | `true`, -1 | The §E3.6.4.2.3 notch across the seam. Six bits per channel per frame. |
| `aht`, `gaqmod` | `false`, -1 | Adaptive hybrid transform (§E3.4): a second 6-point DCT down each bin across the frame's six blocks. Decided per channel per frame — setting the flag permits it, not forces it. |
| `coupling`, `cplbegf` | `false`, -1 | §E3.3. With `spx` also on, §E3.3.1 derives the coupling end frequency from `spxbegf`. |
| `enhanced` | `false` | §E3.5: enhanced coupling instead of standard — 22 sub-bands, amplitude/angle/chaos-quantized coordinates and a phase-restoring reconstruction built on a full DFT, rather than a single per-band scale factor. Only meaningful with `coupling` also set (`cpl+ecpl`); combines with `spx` the same way standard coupling does. This encoder fits real amplitude/angle coordinates per band (an exact 2-variable linear least squares, since §3.5.5.4's reconstruction is linear in the complex gain the pair expresses) and chooses chaos by searching its 8 legal codes against the decoder's own deterministic de-correlation sequence. Two genuinely different channels forced into one narrow coupling band still cost quality — a single coordinate per band has a real, structural limit on what it can separate — but it is no longer the amplitude-only fit's all-or-nothing loss. |
| `transient_prenoise` | `false` | §3.7 (`tpn`): a post-IMDCT correction that overwrites the pre-echo ahead of a detected transient with a synthesized copy of the clean audio just before it. Reuses the same transient detector block switching relies on, so it only has an effect on channels/frames that also block-switch. See [Decoding](decoding.md) for the one-frame decoder-side latency this introduces and the `flush()` call it requires. |
| `fast_mdct` | `true` | The §7.9.4 fast N/4-FFT forward MDCT instead of the direct §8.2.3.2 evaluation — a performance choice, not a coding tool: nothing in the bitstream's syntax changes, only how the coefficients were computed (verified ~3e-12 max relative error against the direct form; 0.000 dB SNR delta against an independent oracle at 192–448 kbps). `false` forces the direct reference form, which stays maintained as the oracle the fast path is validated against — the CLI spells that `tools=nofastmdct`. Only the long transform accelerates today; a block-switched channel's short transforms always run direct. |
| `mixing` | none | The `mixmdate` group (Table E1.2). E-AC-3 dropped `cmixlev`/`surmixlev` from `bsi` entirely, so without this the stream carries no downmix levels at all. |
| `strmtyp`, `substreamid`, `chanmap`, `last_dependent` | independent, 0, none, false | Substream identity. Set by `AccessUnitEncoder`; you rarely touch these directly. |
| `oba_complexity_index` | none | TS 103 420 §8.3 object count in `addbsi`. This is the marker FFmpeg keys its "Dolby Digital Plus + Dolby Atmos" report off. |

## How `auto` chooses

`FrameConfig::auto_tools` (the CLI's `tools=auto`) hands the tool set to the encoder instead of
naming it. It overrides `coupling`/`spx`/`aht` rather than combining with them: when it is set
they are not read at all, while `cplbegf`/`spxbegf`/`gaqmod` still steer the geometry of whatever
it does turn on.

It decides from two things — the per-channel bitrate, and the frame itself. The content half is
measured from the MDCT coefficients the transform has already produced, so it costs a pass over
the affected region and no second transform:

| Measure | What it is | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| coupling fit | How much of the coupling region's energy survives the decoder's own reconstruction of it. §7.4.1's shared channel is the coefficient sum and the transmitted coordinate restores each band's energy, so the residual against that rank-one shape is what coupling costs — this is evaluated, not estimated. 1.0 is a perfect fit (every channel already a scalar multiple of the sum, which is what near-mono material looks like above 8 kHz); independent channels of equal level land at `2/sqrt(n) - 1`, which is 0.41 for a stereo pair and slightly negative for five. | Whether to couple, and how far above the fixed rate ceiling coupling may reach. |
| extension energy share | How much of the frame's energy sits above the extension frequency. | Whether to extend: the ceiling runs from 110 kbit/s per channel where the top end is nearly empty down to 55 where it carries real content. |

The rules that fall out of those:

- **Spectral extension** is on below a ceiling that moves with the energy share above. A frame
  whose top end is nearly empty — which is most real programme material — gets synthesis at up to
  96 kbit/s per channel, because what synthesis replaces there is a band the coder was about to
  spend nothing on and drop. A frame whose top end carries real content loses it by 64.
- **Coupling** needs a fit of 0.99 or better *and* a region at least four sub-bands wide.
  §E3.3.1 derives `cplendf` from `spxbegf`, so wherever synthesis is in use coupling is left one
  or two sub-bands — 12 or 24 coefficients — which cannot repay a coordinate per band per channel
  plus a shared channel the allocator buys bits for. In practice `auto` now couples rarely.
- **AHT** is always permitted and decided per channel per frame by whether the six blocks look
  alike, which was already a content decision.
- **Enhanced coupling** and **transient pre-noise processing** are never chosen by `auto` — see
  [What `auto` will not choose](#what-auto-will-not-choose) below.

Under VBR there is no fixed target rate, so `VbrConfig::nominal_kbps` (or `max_kbps`, or 192)
stands in for it. The content half is unaffected: it reads the frame either way, which is most of
what makes the VBR case work at all.

### What `auto` will not choose

Both of these are fully implemented, decode correctly in this project's own decoder at every
layout, and have their own CI legs. Neither is in `auto`'s set, for different reasons.

**Enhanced coupling (§E3.5)** is not a quality problem. Measured on real programme material —
six 12 s excerpts of a 5.1 theatrical mix at six (layout, rate) points — it scores *above*
standard coupling on ViSQOL MOS-LQO at every one of them: +0.54 MOS-LQO at 96 kbit/s stereo, +0.31 at 128 and +0.18 at 192, and +0.78 / +0.55 / +0.16 at 192 / 256 / 384 kbit/s 5.1. Every SNR trend
row records it as a loss, and both are true: a phase-restoring reconstruction built on a full DFT
does not preserve the waveform, it preserves what the waveform sounded like. (Against `auto`'s
own set the margin is smaller — once spectral extension is chosen properly it has already taken
most of the band coupling would have worked on — which is a reason to read the two coupling
reconstructions against each other rather than against the whole tool set.)

What rules it out is interoperability. FFmpeg's Annex E parser has no model of §E3.5's syntax at
all — it does not decline an enhanced-coupling stream, it misreads it and reports a corrupt
frame — and `auto` is the tool set a caller gets for asking for nothing in particular, so it has
to stay decodable by the decoders that exist. `cpl+ecpl` still asks for it explicitly, and on a
closed pipeline with a decoder known to read it, the measurements say to.

**Transient pre-noise processing (§3.7)** does not pay at all, and the measurement is
unambiguous. It overwrites the decoded audio ahead of a transient with a copy of the audio 512
samples earlier. That substitution's error is a property of the material, not of the coder: over
exactly the samples it touches it measures 20.7–22.5 dB at every bitrate tried, flat. The coder's
own error over those same samples is 11.9 dB at 96 kbit/s stereo and −3.3 dB at 256 — it improves
with rate, and it is already the better of the two at the lowest rate this encoder supports. So
the correction lands between 6.5 and 24 dB *worse* than leaving the audio alone, everywhere it
fires, and the gap widens as the rate rises. It is not a bit-allocation effect: outside its own
footprint the two decodes are bit-identical. Perceptually it is a no-op — MOS-LQO matched the
untreated encode to within 0.01 in every row measured.

The mechanism is that block switching gets there first. §3.7 exists to clean up pre-echo, and
this encoder gates the correction on the same transient detector that switches to short
transforms — so it fires exactly where the short transforms have already confined the pre-echo,
and substitutes earlier audio for audio that was not damaged. Treat it as a reference-correctness
tool: it demonstrates the syntax and the §3.7.2 reconstruction, and there is no measured rate or
content at which it improves the result.


Block switching (§8.2.2/§7.9) is automatic here too — no config field. A channel that switches
anywhere in the frame is excluded from both coupling (same reasoning as AC-3's) and, for this
generation only, from AHT for that frame: AHT's own "stationary" premise (§E3.4, the opposite of
what triggered the switch) already selects against a switching channel most of the time, but the
exclusion is explicit rather than relying on that correlation.

Rematrixing (§7.5.3) is automatic too, `acmod` 2/0 only, no config field — the same minimum-power
decision AC-3's own encoder makes (see [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md#rematrixing)), over the same Table 7.25
bands. Annex E §3.3's "Modifications to Previously Defined Parameters" only changes how many of
those bands are active (`nrematbd`, accounting for coupling, enhanced coupling and spectral
extension all separately taking over the top of the spectrum) — the boundaries and the decision
rule are untouched, so nothing here needed reinventing beyond that band count and clamping the
last active band to wherever this channel's own coding actually stops.

The bit allocation parameters are transmitted rather than inherited (`bamode` 1). Table E1.4's
own `bamode == 0` defaults are not §8.2.12's basic-encoder set — most of the two agree, but
`floorcod` is 0x7 against §8.2.12's 4 — so "inherit" was never the same thing as "what AC-3
does". Sending them costs `baie` plus eleven bits in block 0 and one bit in each of the other
five, 17 a frame; it buys `dbpbcod` 3, the one departure the AC-3 encoder measured its way to
(see [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md)), which lifts the masking curve over bands quieter than
`dbknee` and sends their bits to bands that hold energy. `floorcod` stays at 0x7: it is the
lowest of the eight and never binds, which the same sweep confirmed here as it had for AC-3.

Dither substitution (§7.3.4) works exactly as it does on AC-3 — see
[Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md#dither-substitution) for the rule — with `dithflage` set so the
per-channel flags are transmitted rather than defaulting to on. One narrowing is specific to this
generation: dither is held off entirely for any frame that uses spectral extension. The encoder
holds a reconstruction of what the decoder will produce there, because the extension bands are
scaled to match the copy source's own energy, and the decoder's dither values are not
reproducible from the encoder's side — the sequence a bin receives depends on how many zero-bit
bins the decoder walked before it, across every stream and block. Rather than shadow that
traversal order, the tool that would disturb it is switched off. An AHT channel is left out of
the judgement too: its zero-`hebap` bins reconstruct as literal zero whatever the flag says.

`FrameConfig::dialnorm2` (see "Dual mono" in [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md)) works exactly
the same way here: set it alongside `dialnorm` when `acmod` is `kDualMono`. Dual mono is always a
lone independent substream with no dependents — 1+1 has no bed/dependent split to make — so
`AccessUnitEncoder` gives Ch2 its own `RangeController`/`HeavyCompressor` too, measured on the
independent substream's own two channels the same way it measures Ch1's. It has no VBR
implications either: dual mono is orthogonal to CBR/VBR, since `vbr` only changes how the frame's
*size* is decided, not how many programmes it carries.

## Variable bit rate: `FrameConfig::vbr`

E-AC-3's `frmsiz` states the frame's word count directly rather than indexing a table, so unlike
AC-3 a frame is free to be a different size than the one before it. Setting `vbr` switches a
`FrameConfig` from CBR (size fixed from `bitrate_kbps`) to VBR (size follows the content, at a
chosen quality):

```cpp
ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder encoder{{
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,  // not read once vbr is set — see below
    .acmod = ac3::Acmod::k2_0,
    .vbr = ac3::eac3::VbrConfig{
        .quality = 0.4,
        .max_kbps = 320,  // optional ceiling
    },
}};
```

| `VbrConfig` field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | `0.5` | `[0, 1]`, linearly maps onto the encoder's own SNR-offset search space. Encoder-relative, not a perceptual scale — and **not linear in bit cost**: cost rises steeply in roughly the top third of the range, so a high quality with no `max_kbps` bound will often refuse ordinary multi-channel material outright (`FrameError::kInvalidBitrate`) rather than produce an oversized frame. |
| `min_kbps`, `max_kbps` | none, none | Optional hard bounds, same unit as `bitrate_kbps`. When the quality target would need more words than `max_kbps` allows, the encoder falls back to the same search CBR uses, budgeted against the ceiling — so a bounded VBR frame is never worse than the best CBR could do at that rate. `min_kbps` is a pure floor: `finish_frame`'s own padding covers the gap. |
| `nominal_kbps` | none | Drives the `cplbegf`/`spxbegf` frequency defaults in place of a fixed target rate. Defaults to `max_kbps` if set, else 192. A caller who wants today's CBR tool behaviour at some quality supplies the same number they would have passed as `bitrate_kbps`. |

`bitrate_kbps` itself is not read on the encode path at all once `vbr` is set: when neither
`nominal_kbps` nor `max_kbps` is given, the frequency defaults fall back to the fixed
`kVbrDefaultNominalKbps` (192), not to `bitrate_kbps`.

`AccessUnitConfig` needs no separate VBR field: each substream's own `FrameConfig::vbr` carries
what it needs, and `plan::eac3_config()` shares one `VbrConfig` across every substream of a
`plan::Plan`, halving `min_kbps`/`max_kbps`/`nominal_kbps` for dependents the same way it already
halves `bitrate_kbps` — substreams occupy one frame period, not one frame.

Silent frames (`build_silent_frame`) and AC-3 (`plan::Codec::kAc3`) both reject a `vbr` config
outright: silence has no content to size a quality target against, and AC-3's `frmsizecod` has no
free word count to vary in the first place.

## Wide layouts: `ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder`

Anything past 5.1 rides in *dependent substreams* beside a self-sufficient 5.1 bed. Every
substream codes the same 1536 samples of the same programme; a dependent contributes only its
own channels, its `chanmap`, and its share of the bit rate.

```cpp
// The bed is self-sufficient: a decoder that reads only the independent
// substream gets a complete 5.1 programme.
ac3::eac3::AccessUnitConfig config;
config.independent = {
    .bitrate_kbps = 384,
    .acmod = ac3::Acmod::k3_2,
    .lfe = true,
};
// Each dependent gets its own slice of the rate — substreams share a frame
// period, not a frame — and a Table E2.5 chanmap naming where its channels
// belong. Per §E3.8.2 the locations that collide with the bed replace it
// and the rest extend the layout.
config.dependents.push_back({
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,
    .acmod = ac3::Acmod::k2_2,
    .chanmap = ac3::eac3::chanmap::k71Rear,  // Ls, Rs, Lrs, Rrs
});
config.dependents.push_back({
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,
    .acmod = ac3::Acmod::k2_2,
    .chanmap = ac3::eac3::chanmap::kTopQuad,  // Vhl, Vhr, Lts, Rts
});

ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder encoder{config};
```

Channels are grouped by substream in transmission order: the independent's first in Table 5.8
order with LFE last, then each dependent's in the order its `chanmap` names them.
`encoder.channel_count()` is the total, and the span count `encode_access_unit` expects.

```cpp
const auto unit = encoder.encode_access_unit(views);
// unit->bytes is the wire order already; substream_bytes records the
// per-substream boundaries, which crc2 is computed over.
stream.insert(stream.end(), unit->bytes.begin(), unit->bytes.end());
```

Full program: [`examples/encode_eac3.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/encode_eac3.cpp).

Constraints: at most 8 dependents; a dependent may not disagree with its parent on sample
rate; and the locations a `chanmap` names must add up to the channels its `acmod` and `lfeon`
actually code, or you get `FrameError::kInvalidChannelMap`. A single dependent codes at most 5
full-bandwidth channels, which is why 7.1.4 — six channels beyond the bed — needs two.

Useful `chanmap` constants (`ac3/core/eac3_tables.hpp`, Table E2.5):

| Constant | Channels | Gives you |
|---|---|---|
| `k71Rear` | Ls, Rs, Lrs, Rrs | 7.1 (the surrounds replace the bed's, the rears are new) |
| `k512Height` | Vhl, Vhr | 5.1.2 |
| `kTopQuad` | Vhl, Vhr, Lts, Rts | 5.1.4 |
| `k71Rear` + `kTopQuad` | both of the above | 7.1.4, in two dependents |

`chanmap::expand(map)` turns a map into a `Layout` you can iterate, and `chanmap::name`
gives each location's short name.
