# C API

Roadmap item F1: a stable, minimal C-callable surface over `ac3::forge`'s encode/decode core —
AC-3, E-AC-3 and Atmos (OAMD + JOC) — for bindings and embedding by callers that cannot or do not
want to link C++23. The whole surface is one header,
[`ac3forge_c/ac3forge.h`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/capi/include/ac3forge_c/ac3forge.h),
plain C11 with no C++ type crossing it anywhere — only opaque handles and POD structs. It is a
separate library from `ac3::forge`: link `ac3::forge_c` instead, not both.

[`examples/capi_encode_decode.c`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/capi_encode_decode.c)
is a complete, buildable program (compiled as C, not C++, so the build itself proves the header
is genuinely C-usable) — the excerpts below are drawn from it. `tests/capi/test_capi.cpp` covers the
rest of the surface, including E-AC-3/Atmos decode and the error paths, from Catch2.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ac3::forge_c)
```

`ac3::forge_c` resolves to whichever of the static or shared build the enclosing project's
`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` asks for, same as `ac3::forge`; an installed package exports both variants
explicitly as `ac3::forge_c_static`/`ac3::forge_c_shared` — see [Using ac3::forge](index.md) for
the equivalent `ac3::forge` linking recipe. Unlike `ac3::forge`, **both** `ac3forge_c` variants
statically embed the codec core regardless of `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: a binding or embedder reaching
for a C ABI wants exactly one library to `dlopen`/`ctypes`/`ffi.dlopen`, not a second
`libac3forge.so` to also track down and ship — see `src/capi/CMakeLists.txt`'s header comment.

Built by default (`-DAC3FORGE_BUILD_CAPI=OFF` to skip it); it needs nothing `ac3::forge` itself
doesn't.

## Conventions

**Every fallible function returns `ac3forge_status_t`.** `AC3FORGE_OK` is always zero, so
`if (ac3forge_xxx(...) != AC3FORGE_OK)` and the shorter `if (status)` are equally correct.
`ac3forge_status_message()` gives a short human-readable description for logging.

**Every handle is opaque and owned.** `ac3forge_encoder_t`, `ac3forge_decoded_frame_t`, and every
other `..._t` here are forward-declared structs — only pointers to them cross the header. Each has
a matching `_destroy` function; passing `NULL` to one is a no-op, matching `free()`. A function
producing a variable-length or structured result (a decoded frame, an encoded frame's bytes, a
list of OAMD objects) writes an owned handle through an out-parameter rather than filling a
caller-supplied buffer, so nothing here requires the caller to predict a size up front — the
pointee is left untouched on failure. Read it through the type's accessor functions, then destroy
it.

**No exception ever crosses this boundary.** `ac3::FrameError`/`ac3::DecodeError` map one-for-one
onto `ac3forge_status_t` codes (`AC3FORGE_ERROR_ENCODE_*`/`AC3FORGE_ERROR_DECODE_*`); an actual
C++ exception — realistically only `std::bad_alloc` for a codec core that never throws on its own
— is caught inside the library and reported as `AC3FORGE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` or
`AC3FORGE_ERROR_INTERNAL` instead of propagating into a (possibly non-C++) caller frame.

**No ABI-compatibility promise before v1.0.** Same pre-1.0 stance as the rest of the project (see
roadmap item AP1): a rebuild against a newer `ac3forge` may need a recompile, not merely a relink.
`ac3forge_version()` reports what was actually linked at runtime.

## Encoding

```c
ac3forge_encoder_config_t encoder_config;
ac3forge_encoder_config_init(&encoder_config);   // same defaults as EncoderConfig{}
encoder_config.bitrate_kbps = 192;
encoder_config.acmod = AC3FORGE_ACMOD_2_0;        // L, R

ac3forge_encoder_t* encoder = NULL;
ac3forge_status_t status = ac3forge_encoder_create(&encoder_config, &encoder);
```

`ac3forge_encoder_encode_frame` takes `ac3forge_encoder_channel_count(encoder)` channel pointers,
each exactly `AC3FORGE_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME` (1536) samples, and writes one complete syncframe into an
owned `ac3forge_bytes_t`:

```c
const float* channels[2] = {left, right};
ac3forge_bytes_t* encoded = NULL;
status = ac3forge_encoder_encode_frame(encoder, channels, 2, AC3FORGE_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME, &encoded);
/* ac3forge_bytes_data(encoded) / ac3forge_bytes_size(encoded), then ac3forge_bytes_destroy(encoded) */
```

`EncoderConfig`'s DRC field is exposed through the five named `ac3forge_drc_profile_t` presets
(`AC3FORGE_DRC_FILM_STANDARD`, `..._SPEECH`, …) — the same presets `ac3cli --drc` accepts — rather
than the full custom curve struct, which stays a C++-only tuning knob; see [Metadata](metadata.md)
for what each preset means.

## Decoding

`ac3forge_decoder_t` (AC-3) and `ac3forge_eac3_decoder_t` (E-AC-3/Atmos) mirror `FrameDecoder` and
`Eac3Decoder` — `ac3forge_decoder_decode_frame`/`ac3forge_eac3_decoder_decode_substream`/
`ac3forge_eac3_decoder_decode_access_unit` return an owned `ac3forge_decoded_frame_t`/
`ac3forge_decoded_substream_t`/`ac3forge_decoded_access_unit_t`, read through accessors and then
destroyed:

```c
ac3forge_decoded_frame_t* decoded = NULL;
status = ac3forge_decoder_decode_frame(decoder, data, size, &decoded);
int channels = (int)ac3forge_decoded_frame_channel_count(decoded);
const float* left = ac3forge_decoded_frame_channel_samples(decoded, 0);
ac3forge_decoded_frame_destroy(decoded);
```

`decode_substream`/`decode_access_unit` keep the C++ API's `std::optional`-via-return convention
for transient pre-noise processing's held-back frame (see [Decoding](decoding.md)): a return of
`AC3FORGE_OK` with the out-parameter left `NULL` means the frame's PCM is being held, not an
error. Call `ac3forge_eac3_decoder_flush()` at end of stream to collect it.

## Object audio (OAMD + JOC)

A decoded E-AC-3 substream or access unit that carries an Atmos object container exposes it
through `ac3forge_decoded_substream_has_object_metadata()`/
`ac3forge_decoded_access_unit_has_object_metadata()` and a parallel set of accessors — program
shape (`program_dynamic_only`/`program_lfe`/`program_bed`), each dynamic object's room-anchored
position and gain (`..._dynamic_object`), and JOC's reconstructed per-object audio
(`..._object_audio`/`..._object_audio_count`), index-parallel to the dynamic objects. See
[Spatial & Atmos objects](spatial-and-atmos.md) for what the position/gain values mean and how
`ac3forge_atmos_encoder_t` (the C counterpart to `ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`) produces them.

## What is deliberately out of scope

The self-check/mirror tracing (`ac3::verify::FrameTrace`) is a C++-oriented encoder-implementer
diagnostic, not part of this consumer-facing surface — see [Header map](header-map.md). The full
custom `ac3::meta::Profile` DRC curve (attack/release timing, boost ratios) is likewise a C++-only
tuning knob; the C API exposes only the five named presets (above). Internal kernel-level
benchmarking entry points such as `ac3::oba::band_energy` are excluded outright — their own C++
doc comments already say no caller outside the library should need them directly.
