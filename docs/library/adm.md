# ADM / BW64 reading: `ac3adm::ac3adm`

`ac3adm/ac3adm.hpp`, library `ac3adm::ac3adm`. A standalone BW64/RF64 + Audio Definition Model
(ADM) parser: the professional delivery format Netflix's and Apple's own Atmos ingest pipelines
require. Like `matroska::matroska`, `mp4::mp4` and `mpegts::mpegts`, it links nothing from
`ac3::forge` — it has no idea AC-3, E-AC-3 or the JOC/Atmos object layer exist. It differs from
those three in one way: they are container **writers**, this is a container **reader**, because
that's the direction a professional master needs to travel to reach this project's own encoder
in the first place.

Mapping the graph this module parses onto `ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder` is a separate module,
[`ac3::admbridge`](adm-bridge.md) (done); driving the two together end to end — a real ADM BWF
master straight to a DD+ JOC E-AC-3 stream — is also done: `ac3cli atmos-adm` (see
[Commands](../cli/commands.md)) and
[`examples/encode_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/encode_adm.cpp). This page and
[`examples/read_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/read_adm.cpp) only demonstrate this module's own API — opening a file and walking the
parsed graph; `encode_adm.cpp` is the one that shows the full pipeline.

**Opt-in, unlike every other module in this library.** `AC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM` defaults **off**, and
turning it on additionally needs `-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=adm` (see
[`vcpkg.json`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/vcpkg.json)) to resolve its Boost dependency:

```bash
cmake --preset config-windows-msvc-debug -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=adm
```

Every other target in this project — `ac3cli`, `ac3gui`, `ac3tests`, every other example — builds
identically whether `AC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM` is on or off; nothing links `ac3adm::ac3adm`
unconditionally. See "Why opt-in" below for the reasoning.

```cpp
const auto document = ac3adm::parse_bw64(fixture_path);
if (!document) {
    std::printf("parse_bw64 failed: %.*s\n", static_cast<int>(ac3adm::describe(document.error()).size()),
                ac3adm::describe(document.error()).data());
    return 1;
}
```

```cpp
for (const auto& programme : document->model.programmes) {
    std::printf("  programme %s (%s) -> %zu content(s)\n", programme.id.c_str(), programme.name.c_str(),
                programme.content_refs.size());
}
for (const auto& object : document->model.objects) {
    std::printf("  object %s (%s), start=%.5fs, %zu track UID ref(s)\n", object.id.c_str(), object.name.c_str(),
                object.start_s, object.track_uid_refs.size());
}
```

Full program: [`examples/read_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/examples/read_adm.cpp) — writes a small but genuinely valid BW64 fixture (adapted
from Recommendation ITU-R BS.2076-2's own worked "Car" object example) to a temp file, since a
real ADM BWF master is production audio this project has no license to embed, then parses it
back and prints what it found.

## What gets parsed

- **The container** (Recommendation ITU-R BS.2088-1, Annex 1): `<fmt >`/`<data>` integer PCM
  (8/16/24/32-bit — see "Known limitation" below for float32), the `<ds64>` 64-bit size table for
  `RF64`/`BW64`-headed files, `<chna>` (the track-number ↔ ADM-ID join table) and `<axml>` (the
  embedded ADM XML document itself). A plain `RIFF` header is accepted too, for the (very common)
  case of a master that stays under the 4 GB threshold RF64 exists to lift.
- **The ADM object graph** (Recommendation ITU-R BS.2076-2, Annex 1): `audioProgramme` →
  `audioContent` → `audioObject` → `audioPackFormat`/`audioChannelFormat` (with its
  `audioBlockFormat` time-divisions — position, gain, width/height/depth, `channelLock`,
  `jumpPosition`, HOA order/degree/normalization) → `audioStreamFormat`/`audioTrackFormat` →
  `audioTrackUID`. See [`ac3adm/model.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/include/ac3adm/model.hpp) for exactly which sub-elements are carried and which
  are deliberately out of phase 1's scope (`zoneExclusion`, `objectDivergence`, `screenRef`, the
  Matrix/Binaural-specific sub-elements, and loudness metadata — `ac3::meta::loudness` already
  measures loudness independently).

**`model` always includes BS.2076-2 Annex A's "common definitions".** libadm's own `parseXml()`
starts every document from a copy already populated with the standard's ~940 predefined
pack/channel/stream/track/block formats (one set per standard loudspeaker layout and first- to
third-order HOA component) and merges the file's own content into it, so that a file referencing
a common-definition ID (e.g. a stereo bed's pack format `AP_00010002`) without locally
re-declaring it still resolves. This module keeps that merge rather than filtering it back out:
phase 2 needs exactly this, a pack/channel/stream/track format reference that resolves regardless
of whether the file re-declared it — so `model.pack_formats`/`channel_formats`/`stream_formats`/
`track_formats` are never just "what this one file defined". `model.programmes`/`contents`/
`objects`/`track_uids` are unaffected (the common set defines none of those four).

`AdmDocument` — the `parse_bw64` result — holds all three pieces together: `model` (the graph
above), `chna` (the join table, one `ChnaEntry` per physical-track-to-ADM-ID row), and `audio`
(the decoded PCM, one `std::vector<float>` per channel, same `[-1, 1)` normalization convention
`ac3::io::WavData` uses). `AdmError` covers open/parse failure — `kCannotOpen`, `kNotRiff`,
`kMissingFmt`, `kMissingData`, `kUnsupportedFormat`, `kMalformedXml`, `kMalformedAdm`, `kOther`;
see [`ac3adm/ac3adm.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/include/ac3adm/ac3adm.hpp) for the full list. In practice, the two libraries underneath this
module (see below) report almost everything through one broad exception family each, so most
real failures currently surface as `kCannotOpen` (bad/truncated container), `kMalformedXml` (axml
isn't well-formed XML) or `kMalformedAdm` (well-formed XML that isn't a valid ADM document) — see
[`src/ac3adm/src/adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/src/adm.cpp)'s own comments for exactly which library exception maps to which `AdmError`.

## Built on the EBU's own reference implementations

Unlike every other module in this project, `ac3adm::ac3adm` is not a from-scratch, dependency-free
implementation. It is a thin translation layer over two vendored third-party libraries, fetched
via CMake `FetchContent` (see [`src/ac3adm/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/CMakeLists.txt)):

- **[libbw64](https://github.com/ebu/libbw64)** (Apache-2.0, header-only, no dependency of its
  own) — the BW64/RF64 chunk-walking and PCM-decoding layer.
- **[libadm](https://github.com/ebu/libadm)** (Apache-2.0) — the ADM XML object model: parsing,
  schema validation, and the full element graph.

Both are maintained by the BBC/IRT team that also authored the underlying ITU-R Recommendations
(BS.2088-1, BS.2076-2) themselves — using them means this module's own code only has to translate
an already-validated object graph into `ac3adm`'s own types
([`src/ac3adm/src/adm_model.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/src/adm_model.cpp)), rather than re-implementing container-walking and XML/schema
validation this project has no comparative advantage in getting exactly right on the first try.
An earlier attempt at exactly that hand-rolled approach is what prompted switching to these
libraries instead.

Neither library's own types appear in `ac3adm::ac3adm`'s public headers
(`ac3adm/ac3adm.hpp`, `ac3adm/model.hpp`) — they are translated into this module's own types at
the boundary and stay an implementation detail, the same way this project keeps every other
vendored dependency (e.g. Catch2 in `tests/`) out of its own public API. One practical reason
beyond the usual "don't leak a dependency's API" one: libadm's own public C++ namespace is `adm`,
which is why this module is `ac3adm` and not simply `adm` — the two would otherwise collide
(`adm::AudioObject`, `adm::TypeDefinition`, `adm::Position`, ... are all defined by both).

## Why opt-in

libadm needs several Boost header libraries (Optional, Variant, Range, Iterator, Functional,
Format, Integer and Rational — the exact list confirmed by grepping libadm 0.14.0's own
`#include <boost/...>` directives, not guessed from its README, which undersells it: Rational
and Integer aren't mentioned there at all, but `adm/utilities/time_conversion.hpp` needs both).
Every other dependency in this project is either in-tree or a single small vcpkg
package (Catch2); pulling in Boost is a materially bigger footprint, so it is deliberately
**opt-in rather than default-on** — `AC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM` defaults `OFF` (unlike
`AC3FORGE_BUILD_MATROSKA`/`AC3FORGE_BUILD_MP4`/`AC3FORGE_BUILD_MPEGTS`, which default `ON`), and
turning it on needs the dedicated `adm` vcpkg feature to resolve those Boost packages. A build
with `AC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=OFF` (the default) never touches `find_package(Boost)`, never fetches
libbw64/libadm, and behaves identically to a build of this project before this module existed.

For the same reason, `ac3adm::ac3adm` is **not** part of the installed `find_package(ac3forge)`
package (see [the library overview](index.md)) and is **not** wired into the Android/Shield NDK
build — see `src/ac3adm/CMakeLists.txt`'s own header comment for both.

## PCM formats

Integer PCM (8/16/24/32-bit) and IEEE float (32/64-bit) both read, and both come back as the
same `[-1, 1)` floats on `PcmAudio::channels`. `bits_per_sample` reports the container width and
is not, on its own, a statement about which of the two it was.

The two arrive by different routes. Integer PCM goes through the vendored libbw64, which is also
this module's reference for the container itself. libbw64's own `<fmt >` parsing rejects any
other `formatTag` outright at open time (`"format unsupported: <tag>"`), IEEE float included, so
a float master never reaches any of its accessors and there is nothing to widen from the
outside. Rather than patch a dependency fetched from upstream at a pinned tag, a float file is
detected up front and read by this module's own container walk instead
([`src/ac3adm/src/float_pcm_bw64.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/src/float_pcm_bw64.hpp)) —
which re-implements the chunk walk and the `<chna>` record table and nothing else: the `<axml>`
bytes go through the identical libadm parse the ordinary path uses, so the ADM metadata cannot
come out differently depending on how the samples were stored.

That path is also the only one that can report `AdmError::kNotRiff`/`kMissingFmt`/`kMissingData`/
`kUnsupportedFormat` precisely, because it does the walk itself. A file libbw64 opens and then
rejects still surfaces as `kCannotOpen`, since its exceptions carry no type this module could map
from — see [`ac3adm.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/src/ac3adm/include/ac3adm/ac3adm.hpp)'s
own comment on those four errors.

Most real ADM BWF masters are 16- or 24-bit integer (EBU Tech 3306/BS.2088-1 Annex 2 §2's own
PCM-only framing). Float ones exist, and used to be refused outright.
