# AC-3: `ac3::FrameEncoder`

`ac3/encoder/encoder.hpp`. One call, one syncframe.

```cpp
// Heap-allocated: FrameEncoder carries several KB of MDCT scratch/history
// state (PREfast's C6262).
auto encoder = std::make_unique<ac3::FrameEncoder>(ac3::EncoderConfig{
    .bitrate_kbps = 448,
    .acmod = ac3::Acmod::k3_2,  // L, C, R, SL, SR
    .lfe = true,
});

// Table 5.8 order, LFE last, exactly kSamplesPerFrame (1536) samples each.
std::vector<std::vector<float>> pcm(6, std::vector<float>(ac3::kSamplesPerFrame));
// encode_frame takes a span of spans, so the views must outlive the call.
// Build them once and refill the buffers underneath each frame.
const std::vector<std::span<const float>> views{pcm.begin(), pcm.end()};

std::vector<std::byte> stream;
for (int frame = 0; frame < 31; ++frame) {  // 48000 / 1536, near enough
    fill_with_audio(pcm, frame, 48000.0);

    const auto encoded = encoder->encode_frame(views);
    if (!encoded) {
        std::printf("encode failed: %d\n", std::to_underlying(encoded.error()));
        return 1;
    }
    write(stream, *encoded);  // one complete syncframe
}
```

## `EncoderConfig`

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sample_rate` | `k48000` | Also `k44100`, `k32000`. |
| `bitrate_kbps` | 192 | Must be one of the 19 Table 5.18 rates; `ac3::is_valid_bitrate` checks. |
| `dialnorm` | 31 | 1–31 (§5.4.2.8). 31 means "no attenuation", which is a claim about your content. |
| `chbwcod` | -1 | Coded bandwidth, 0–60. -1 derives it from the bit rate. |
| `acmod` | `k2_0` | Table 5.8, including `kDualMono` (1+1) — see below. |
| `dialnorm2` | none | `std::optional<int>`. Ch2's own dialnorm (§5.4.2.16); required when `acmod` is `kDualMono`, meaningless otherwise. |
| `lfe` | `false` | Adds one channel, coded last. |
| `coupling` | `false` | §7.4. Needs ≥ 2 full-bandwidth channels. |
| `cplbegf`, `cplendf` | -1, -1 | Sub-band indices; -1 lets the encoder choose from the per-channel rate. |
| `fast_mdct` | `true` | The §7.9.4 fast N/4-FFT forward MDCT instead of the direct §8.2.3.2 evaluation (~25× on the long-transform kernel, identical streams to within ~3e-12 coefficient error). `false` forces the direct reference form, kept as the validation oracle — the CLI spells that `fast-mdct=off`. |
| `drc` | none | `std::optional<meta::Profile>`. Absent leaves `dynrnge` clear in every block. |
| `heavy` | none | `std::optional<meta::HeavyConfig>`. Independent of `drc`. |
| `drc2` | none | `std::optional<meta::Profile>`. Ch2's own DRC, meaningful only under `kDualMono` — no fallback to `drc` when unset (see below). |
| `heavy2` | none | `std::optional<meta::HeavyConfig>`. Ch2's own heavy compression, same rule as `drc2`. |
| `cmixlev`, `surmixlev` | −4.5 dB, −6 dB | Tables 5.9/5.10. Always define the §7.8 downmix, whatever `acmod` is. |

Coupling is what makes 5.1 viable below 448 kbit/s: above the coupling frequency the
full-bandwidth channels stop carrying their own coefficients and share one coupling channel
plus per-band coordinates.

### Block switching

Automatic — no config field toggles it. A §8.2.2 transient detector runs per full-bandwidth
channel per block, and when **any** eligible channel switches anywhere in the frame, coupling is
turned off for that entire frame, for **every** channel — not just the one that switched.
`chincpl` in this encoder is frame-wide all-or-nothing rather than a per-channel flag, so the
§8.2.4.1 exclusion of a switching channel from coupling can only be honoured by disabling the
tool outright. The LFE never switches.

### Delta bit allocation

Automatic too (§7.2.2.6) — no config field. For each exponent run the encoder builds the masking
curve a second time from the real pre-quantization coefficient magnitudes and compares it against
the curve the transmitted exponents alone imply — which is all a decoder's allocator ever sees.
Any band where the two diverge by at least one Table 5.17 step (128 units, 6 dB) gets a
transmitted correction. The decision is per channel; the LFE is excluded, because §5.4.3.49's
`deltbae` loop stops short of it — no bitstream field exists to carry an LFE correction at all.
On AC-3 the coupling channel is in scope like any full-bandwidth channel, and `cpldeltbae` is
emitted as new information whenever it has segments to send. Two narrowings apply today: the
E-AC-3 encoder skips delta entirely for any frame where coupling is active (the added side
information broke the tightest coupling budgets — exactly the rates coupling exists to rescue),
and both encoders treat delta as a pure quality refinement — when its side-information cost would
make an otherwise-fittable frame fail to fit, the corrections are dropped and the frame
re-measured rather than refused.

### Dither substitution

Automatic as well (§7.3.4) — no config field. `dithflag` is one bit per full-bandwidth channel
per block and is transmitted whichever way it reads, so the decision costs nothing; what it
decides is what the decoder puts in the bins the allocator gave no bits to. Per channel per
block, the encoder sums the real coefficient energy over those bins and compares it against the
energy the dither would replace it with (a uniform ±0.707 draw at the bin's own exponent scale,
§7.3.4's own recommended scaling), and sets the flag only when the first is at least as large as
the second — cover a hole, never paper over silence. Digital silence therefore always reads
clear, and a block-switched channel is excluded outright: two interleaved half transforms share
one coefficient set there, so a zero-bit slot is really two half-block bins and filling it
smears noise across the transient. The LFE has no `dithflag` at all (§5.4.3.2's loop is over
full-bandwidth channels), and a coupled channel is judged over both regions it receives — its own
spectrum and the shared coupling channel's band, whose zero-bit bins the decoder dithers per
*receiving* channel.

### Rematrixing

Also automatic, and 2/0 only (§7.5.3) — no config field. Per Table 7.25 band, per block, the
encoder compares the minimum power of the L/R pair against the minimum power of their sum and
difference and codes whichever pair is smaller (`rematflg` per band) — the spec's minimum-power
decision. Strongly correlated stereo then puts nearly everything in the sum channel, and the
difference channel's bits go where they are actually needed.

### Dual mono (`acmod` 0, "1+1")

Not a channel layout — two independent, single-channel programmes sharing one syncframe (a
second language track, a commentary track), each levelled and compressed on its own. Set
`acmod = ac3::Acmod::kDualMono` and `dialnorm2`; `channels[0]` is Ch1, `channels[1]` is Ch2
(`fullbw_channel_count(kDualMono)` is 2, same as stereo, but the two channels are never
downmixed, coupled or rematrixed together — coupling silently stays off even if `coupling` is
set, since averaging two unrelated programmes together would leak one into the other). The
compression fields split the same way `dialnorm`/`dialnorm2` do: `drc` and `heavy` control Ch1
only, and Ch2's compressor/range controller is built **solely** from `drc2`/`heavy2` — there is
no fallback to `drc`/`heavy` when they are unset, so configuring only `drc`/`heavy` sends Ch2
out uncompressed. Each programme then carries its own words: `dynrng`/`compr` for Ch1,
`dynrng2`/`compr2` for Ch2. By convention 1+1 carries no LFE — two unrelated mono programmes
have no shared soundfield for a subwoofer to sit in, and the plan layer never builds one — but
the encoder itself does not reject `lfe = true` here, so a caller assembling an `EncoderConfig`
by hand has to honour the convention itself.
