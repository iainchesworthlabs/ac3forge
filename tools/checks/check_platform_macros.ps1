# Platform-isolation guard.
#
# ac3forge branches on the operating system in CMake, never in the preprocessor:
# src/audio/CMakeLists.txt picks one src/audio/src/backend/<backend>/ directory
# (alsa/android/macos/pipewire/posix/windows) for the target OS, so exactly one
# audio_backend.cpp/capture.cpp/monitor.cpp/passthrough.cpp set is ever
# compiled. That only stays true if nobody reaches for an #ifdef, and an #ifdef
# is the path of least resistance the moment a second platform misbehaves --
# hence this check.
#
# The rule here is stricter than "no OS macros": NO preprocessor conditional of
# any kind is allowed in src/. The codebase has none today, so the check costs
# nothing to keep at zero, and zero is a far easier line to hold than "only the
# justified ones". Header-configuration defines that a platform header genuinely
# requires (WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, NOMINMAX) belong in target_compile_definitions
# -- see the WIN32 block in src/audio/CMakeLists.txt for the worked example.
#
# Include guards are not affected: the codebase uses #pragma once.
#
# One other narrow exception, added for src/capi/include/ac3forge_c/ac3forge.h
# (roadmap F1): `#ifdef __cplusplus` / `extern "C" {` / `#endif` is the
# standard idiom that lets one header be included from both a C and a C++
# translation unit, which a C-callable public header genuinely needs -
# `extern "C"` is not even legal syntax outside `#ifdef __cplusplus`, since a
# .c file's compiler does not know the token. This is a LANGUAGE-DIALECT
# marker, not a platform or feature branch - the thing this check exists to
# forbid - so a bare `#ifdef __cplusplus ... #endif` pair (no #else/#elif
# inside it) is tracked separately below and excluded from violations; every
# other conditional, including one that merely mentions __cplusplus in an
# #if/#elif expression alongside something else, is still flagged.
#
# Usage:  ./tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1 [-Root <repo-root>]
# Exit:   0 = clean, 1 = violation(s) found, 2 = bad invocation.
