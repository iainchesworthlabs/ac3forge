"""Quality race: our encoder vs FFmpeg's, at matched bitrates.

Synthesizes stereo program material (tones with vibrato, a sweep, filtered
noise, correlated near-mono content for rematrixing, tone bursts), encodes it
with both encoders, decodes both with FFmpeg (the neutral referee), aligns by
cross-correlation, and reports SNR vs the original - plus a MOS-LQO column
(ViSQOL audio mode, see perceptual_score()'s own docstring for why ViSQOL
over PEAQ and which package) on the modes that print or export a table.
Gracefully "-" when `visqol-python` isn't installed - it never becomes a
required dependency just to run a quality race.

Modes:
  ac3        - our AC-3 encoder vs FFmpeg's, at 192-448 kbps
  fast-mdct  - direct-form (fast-mdct=off) vs the default §7.9.4 fast
               forward MDCT (EncoderConfig::fast_mdct), both decoded by
               FFmpeg - the quality evidence that made fast the default
  eac3       - our E-AC-3 encoder, one row per Annex E tool set, vs FFmpeg's
               E-AC-3 encoder, at the low rates the tools exist to serve
  eac3-51    - the same for 5.1, with genuinely decorrelated channels
  seam       - where the spectral extension notch lands, and how deep
  crosscheck - every tool set through BOTH decoders: FFmpeg and Dolby's own,
               via the reference player's GStreamer elements. Agreeing with
               one decoder says a stream is readable; agreeing with the
               reference implementation says it is right. Skips gracefully
               when the reference player is not installed.
  ci         - the CI gate: AC-3 and every E-AC-3 tool variant (stereo and
               5.1) against a numeric SNR/LSD floor per variant, real
               non-zero exit on regression. No table to read; see race_ci().
               Enhanced coupling and transient pre-noise processing are
               included too, scored through this project's own decoder
               rather than FFmpeg's (see decode_scores_ours) - neither tool
               has an external oracle at all.
  trend      - the CI-time half of the external-encoder landscape
               comparison (tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py is the local-only
               half that actually invokes FFmpeg/DEE): encodes every
               committed fixed leg with THIS build and scores everything
               through this project's own decoder, so it needs neither
               FFmpeg's nor DEE's own encoder. Compute-only, no gate; see
               race_trend(). `--json-out PATH` writes the rows as JSON.
               `--spectrogram-dir PATH` additionally renders one PNG per leg
               (original/ac3forge/FFmpeg/DEE spectrograms) via
               render_spectrograms() - this part DOES need an `ffmpeg`
               binary, only ever to decode the already-committed
               tests/golden/external-baseline/ bitstreams, never to encode.

Every mode except `ci` and `trend` takes `--material synth|speech|music`,
which swaps the synthesized source for one of the committed 30 s CC0
programme fixtures - see MATERIALS near main() for why that matters and why
those two modes decline it.

#
# SNR and the Bark-banded LSD/HF measures above are waveform- and envelope-
# level proxies for what a listener actually hears. ViSQOL (Google's Virtual
# Speech Quality Objective Listener, https://github.com/google/visqol) scores
# that more directly: a full-reference perceptual model that predicts a
# MOS-LQO (Mean Opinion Score - Listening Quality Objective), 1 (bad) to
# audio mode's ~4.75 ceiling.
#
# Chosen over PEAQ (ITU-R BS.1387): the PEAQ algorithm itself is FRAND-
# licensed ITU IP, not something this clean-room project wants to take a
# dependency on (see docs/concepts/object-signing.md for the same reasoning
# applied to Dolby's own authentication tag), and the one credible open
# implementation, GstPEAQ, documents its own non-conformance to the BS.1387-1
# tolerance and ships only as a GStreamer/C plugin - no Python surface, a
# heavier and less certain dependency than ViSQOL's Apache-2.0 Python package
# for a column that has to stay optional.
#
# Google's own google/visqol repo has no published PyPI wheel: its Python API
# is `pip install .` after a Bazel + TensorFlow source build (confirmed
# against the repo's own README, not assumed), which is not viable as an
# optional dependency for a casual local run or a CI container. `visqol-
# python` (PyPI, Apache-2.0, https://github.com/talker93/visqol-python) is a
# pure-Python reimplementation with prebuilt wheels and no Bazel/C++
# toolchain requirement; its own conformance suite scores audio-mode output
# within 0.0002 MOS-LQO of the reference C++ implementation across its test
# vectors. It bundles the audio-mode SVR model file, so no separate model
# download is needed once the package itself is installed - verified
# locally: identical audio scores ~4.73, a heavily noised copy scores 1.0,
# confirming the number actually moves with quality rather than being a
# stub.
#
# Optional exactly like AC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA (src/audio/CMakeLists.txt): a
# missing `visqol-python` install skips this column with one clear message,
# printed once, and never fails the run. Nobody running a quality race
# locally should be forced to install it, and CI does not either - see
# ffmpeg-validate's own comment in .github/workflows/ci.yml for why.

# each length):
#
#   2 s -> 2.2 s     4 s -> 5.8 s     6 s -> 9.8 s     8 s -> 14.1 s
#   3 s -> 3.9 s    10 s -> 20.5 s   30 s -> 127.8 s
#
# so a 30 s programme fixture costs 30x what a 3 s synthetic one does, and
# `trend` mode makes 62 distinct scoring calls per run across its eight legs.
# Uncapped, the programme legs alone would add over half an hour to a
# pull-request job. Capped at 4 s, the whole column measured about seven
# minutes (a full `trend` run took 10m48s with ViSQOL and 3m59s with it
# stubbed out).
#
# 4 s is where the score itself has converged: the same pair reads 4.336 at
# 2 s, 4.272 at 4 s, 4.257 at 6 s and 4.251 at 8 s, so the residual against a
# much longer window is ~0.02 MOS - and it is a CONSTANT offset, because the
# window is always the same deterministic span of the same fixture. Trend
# deltas, which is what every consumer of this column actually reads, are
# unaffected by a constant offset; only the absolute value moves, and only by
# less than the difference between two adjacent tool sets.

# synthetic legs are NOT retired - their series go back to the first
# baseline, and breaking that continuity to swap material would throw away
# the history the landscape page exists to show.
#
# Second, rates where the Annex E tools actually run. `auto` turns coupling on
# below 12 + 14n kbit/s per channel and spectral extension below 56 (see
# eac3_frame.cpp's coupling_rate_ceiling/kSpxRateCeiling), and the only stereo
# leg sat at 192 kbit/s - 96 per channel, above both - so `auto` chose no
# tools at all there and the landscape never once compared this project's
# Annex E work against FFmpeg's or DEE's at a rate where it exists. The two
# stereo legs added here bracket both crossovers: 96 kbit/s is 48 per channel
# (spectral extension on, coupling off - it isolates spx) and 64 kbit/s is 32
# per channel (both on). The 5.1 legs already sat below both ceilings at
# 256 kbit/s, which is why no low-rate 5.1 leg is added.

    race_coupling above - originally the quality evidence the fast-MDCT PR's
    owner asked for before making fast the default, kept as the standing
    check that the two paths still agree. mdct512_forward's fast path is
    already verified bit-close (~1e-15 absolute error) against the direct
    form in isolation (tests/core/test_mdct_fast.cpp); what this measures is
    whether that residual ever flips a bap/exponent DECISION enough to show
    up against an independent oracle, at real bitrates, on real (if
    synthetic) material.

# `--material speech|music` on the interactive modes: score against one of the
# committed 30 s CC0 programme fixtures instead of make_material()'s
# synthesized tones-and-noise. Opt-in, never a default, and deliberately not
# accepted by `ci` or `trend` - `ci` is a hard gate whose floors were set
# against the synthesized material and would all have to move, and `trend`
# already carries the programme fixtures as their own legs (TREND_LEGS) rather
# than as an alternative source for the existing ones.
#
# This is the knob for the encoder-tuning question this project has already
# been caught by once: a bit-allocation or bandwidth policy that looks like a
# win on the synthetic fixtures needs re-measuring on material that is not
# band-limited like they are, and before this there was nowhere to do that
# except by hand (see src/lib/src/encoder/encoder.cpp's chbwcod comment, and
# tools/generators/gen_programme_fixtures.py for the measured spectra).
