"""Append one CI run's encoder throughput results to the quality-history
branch's per-branch performance JSONL file, and flag a trailing-baseline
slowdown at two tiers: a soft one (::warning::, never fails this script) and
a hard one (::error::, signalled via $GITHUB_OUTPUT's hard_regression so the
caller can fail the job *after* still committing and pushing the data - see
.github/workflows/ci.yml's "persist-performance-trend" job, which fails
after the push so a big regression is never silently un-recorded just
because it also failed the run).

This is the trend-tracking HALF of the performance suite, not the hard
real-time gate - that is tests/performance/test_performance.cpp's ac3perf
target, a separate CI-blocking ctest run on every push/PR. This script only
ever runs on develop/main pushes (mirrors persist_quality_trend's own
gating), records numbers ac3perf's pass/fail already implicitly bounds, and
raises a softer, trend-relative signal on top: not "did this exceed the
absolute real-time budget" (ac3perf's job) but "is this drifting slower over
time even while still passing that gate".

Reads one JSON file per leg - tests/performance/bench_encoder.cpp's
--json-out schema ({"real_time_budget_ms_per_frame": ..., "results": [{name,
frames, total_ms, ms_per_frame}, ...]}) - collected under
--results-dir/<leg>/*.json by CI's download-artifact step, and appends one
JSONL record per (leg, config) to <history-dir>/performance-<branch>.jsonl.
Reuses the quality-history branch (a different file, not a new branch) -
see docs/performance-trend.md.

Mirrors tools/ci/append_quality_history.py closely by design (same shape,
same reasoning) - the one real difference is direction: for quality, LOWER
dB is worse; for performance, HIGHER ms/frame is worse. Percentage-based
thresholds are used here rather than quality-trend's fixed dB deltas,
because ms/frame's absolute scale varies a lot across CI runner hardware in
a way dB (already a log-relative unit) does not.

stdlib-only (json/argparse/pathlib), matching compare_wav.py's/
append_quality_history.py's own no-new-CI-provisioning reasoning. Takes
commit and commit-date as arguments rather than reading the clock itself -
see this project's general rule against Date.now()-style nondeterminism in
tooling; the caller sources commit-date from `git show -s --format=%cI`.

def load_leg_results(results_dir: Path):
    """results_dir holds one subdirectory per leg (an artifact named
    'performance-<preset>', downloaded with the prefix stripped back off by
    the caller - see the workflow step), each holding one or more of
    bench_encoder.cpp's --json-out files.

    MULTIPLE files per leg are reduced to ONE record per (leg, config), not
    appended as several. The workflow runs ac3bench more than once so this
    reduction has something to work on; one file still works and simply
    reduces to itself.

    The reduction is the MINIMUM run, and the whole record is taken from that
    run rather than assembled from per-field minima across different runs -
    so mean, p95 and max in a record always describe the same measurement
    rather than a composite that never happened.

    Minimum, not mean, for the reason compare_performance.py already documents
    for the PR-time comparison: timing noise on a shared runner is one-sided.
    A co-tenant, a thermal event or a page-cache miss can only ever make a run
    slower, never faster, so the fastest of N is the closest estimate of what
    the machine can actually do and the mean mostly measures the neighbours.
    This script previously recorded a SINGLE unrepeated sample straight into
    the permanent history, which is a weaker signal than the PR comparison
    feeding into the same merge already used - the trailing-mean tiers were
    being fed a noisier number than the reviewer saw.

    `runs` and `spread` are recorded alongside so a reader (and
    docs/performance-trend.md) can tell a real move from a noisy one: spread
    is this workload's own (max-min)/min across the repetitions of THIS run,
    the same definition compare_performance.py uses.
