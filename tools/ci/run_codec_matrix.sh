# Exercises ac3cli across the layout/tool/metadata matrix it documents in its
# own --help text, so a sanitizer build's "make it fail loudly" only works if
# something actually walks these code paths. ctest's 200+ cases cover a lot of
# encoder/decoder logic in isolation; this script covers the combinations a
# real user's command line would hit - every layout, every Annex E tool
# token, both Atmos container modes, and the metadata options - round-tripped
# through encode -> decode -> levels/loudness/spdif/mkv/mp4.
#
# Every stream this script produces also gets FFmpeg's independent strict
# decode (CONTRIBUTING.md's "Oracles" list, #2) alongside the in-repo
# decoder's `run decode`, per the verification-gap table in README.md:
#   - The in-repo decoder reads every Annex E tool combination now (standard
#     and enhanced coupling, spectral extension, AHT, transient pre-noise
#     processing, and any combination including 7.1.4 with several at once),
#     so every `run decode` below is a real, asserted round-trip - there is
#     nothing left to tolerate a known refusal against.
#   - FFmpeg still has no oracle at all for 7.1.4 (`714`): its
#     ff_ac3_parse_header rejects a second dependent substream's
#     `substreamid != 0` in every container tried, regardless of which Annex
#     E tools are in play. Those streams skip the FFmpeg check entirely
#     rather than being tolerated - there is nothing to tolerate a decode
#     failure against, and skipping (not tolerating) is what keeps this
#     script from silently claiming FFmpeg coverage it does not have. The
#     in-repo decoder is checked at 7.1.4 same as everywhere else.
#   - Same story, different reason, for enhanced coupling (`ecpl`) and
#     transient pre-noise processing (`tpn`): FFmpeg's own Annex E parser has
#     never read either tool's syntax at all, so there is no "known refusal"
#     to tolerate, just no oracle - see docs/verification.md's own note.
#     Those streams skip the FFmpeg check too; the in-repo decoder round trip
#     still covers them.
#   - One whole COMMAND, not just one FFmpeg check, is conditional: `atmos-adm`
#     (roadmap B1) only runs for real when this build was configured with
#     -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON, which neither of this script's two CI callers'
#     presets turn on - see that command's own block below for the detection
#     and the reasoning.

# --- AC-3: real programme material, across each layout's whole rate range --
# Everything above drives AC-3 from `sine`, `silence`, or bootstrap_51.wav -
# which is itself a decoded sine. Synthetic material cannot reach a whole
# class of encoder state, and not because of some missing option: a
# stationary tone puts near-identical exponents in every block, so
# needs_new_exponents never splits a frame into several exponent runs, and
# any defect that only appears at a mid-frame run boundary is structurally
# unreachable - at every layout, and at every bitrate.
#
# The deltbaie stale-delta defect was exactly that shape. A delta bit
# allocation that stopped part-way through a frame was never cleared, so the
# decoder went on applying it, its allocation diverged from the encoder's,
# and every field after that point was read at the wrong bit offset. It
# produced streams neither this project's decoder nor FFmpeg would accept,
# and it survived this matrix, the fidelity gate and the whole unit suite -
# because none of them ever fed the encoder real programme material. Sweeping
# the rate range on sine would not have caught it either; only the material
# axis does.
#
# So: the golden fixtures, swept rather than pinned to one comfortable rate,
# each stream decoded by BOTH the in-repo decoder and FFmpeg. The rate lists
# are each layout's real lower bound for this material - 5.1 needs 96 kbit/s
# before a frame can carry its own headers, stereo and 1+1 need 48, mono
# reaches the full range. E-AC-3 is not repeated here: quality_race.py's CI
# gate already round-trips these same fixtures through eac3-encode across its
# tool variants, so that path is not blind the way this one was.

# fmp4 writes a directory (init segment + media segments + HLS/DASH
# manifests) rather than one file - atmos_4.ec3 in particular exercises the
# HLS CHANNELS="<N>/JOC" path (mp4/hls.hpp), since that stream carries Dolby
# Atmos objects. Concatenating the init segment with every media segment and
# strict-decoding the result, and strict-decoding the HLS media playlist
# directly, both through FFmpeg's own demuxers, is a stronger check than the
# plain exit-code one every other 'run' call gets here - exactly the
# fragment-boundary/manifest-signaling logic a single-fragment or synthetic
# test cannot exercise.

# ls -v (natural/version sort) matters here, not a plain glob: a plain
# 'segment*.m4s' glob sorts lexicographically ("segment10.m4s" before
# "segment2.m4s"), which would concatenate fragments out of sequence order -
# every moof's mfhd sequence_number/tfdt needs to stay monotonic for a real
# decoder to accept the result.
