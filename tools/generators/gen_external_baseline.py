"""Local-only reference baseline vs FFmpeg's and Dolby DEE's encoders.

This is the one-time (or occasional) step that produces the checked-in
numbers CI's `quality_race.py trend` mode compares every build against.
DEE (Dolby Encoding Engine, bundled in "Dolby Media Encoder" - not the
decode-only Dolby Reference Player used elsewhere) is licensed commercial
software and must never run unattended in CI; FFmpeg's *encoder* is open
but is likewise kept out of the per-commit path so a build never depends on
either tool being present. Run this locally, review the manifest diff it
produces, commit it.

Each score also carries a MOS-LQO prediction (score_tool(), via
quality_race.py's perceptual_score()/ViSQOL) when `visqol-python` is
installed in the environment this runs in - "mos_lqo": null in the manifest
otherwise, same graceful-degradation contract as everywhere else this
project uses it. Installing it here is a one-time, local, opt-in choice by
whoever regenerates the baseline; it is never required to run this script.

Three fixed legs, matched to bitrate points already established elsewhere
in this repo so the numbers are comparable to existing tables:

  ac3-51-448        AC-3,   5.1,    448 kbps, reference_51.wav
  eac3-stereo-192    E-AC-3, stereo, 192 kbps, reference_stereo.wav
  eac3-51-256        E-AC-3, 5.1,    256 kbps, reference_51.wav

For each leg: encode with FFmpeg, encode with DEE, encode with the current
build's ac3cli (a sanity check, not the point of this script - CI's `trend`
mode re-encodes with whatever build is under test).

Scoring decodes FFmpeg's and DEE's output with FFmpeg's own decoder (its
established role everywhere else in this project - see decode_scores'
"neutral referee" docstring), and ac3cli's own output with ac3cli's own
decoder (self-consistency, the same pattern decode_scores_ours uses
elsewhere). This is a deliberate change from decoding every bitstream with
ac3cli's own decoder: FFmpeg's encoder turns out to legally choose Table
E2.12's default coupling band structure (cplbndstrce=0), which this
project's own decoder declines to read (eac3_decoder.cpp - no stream this
project's own encoder produces ever sets that flag, so it was never
exercised against one that does - see the tracked follow-up to fix this and
add CI coverage decoding real third-party output). Scoring external
encoders' output by how well *our* decoder happens to parse their bitstream
choices would also conflate their encoder's quality with our decoder's
coverage - using FFmpeg for both avoids that confound entirely, not just
the crash. (The Dolby Reference Player was also tried here, as a genuine
reference-implementation oracle - but its gst pipeline decoded DEE's own
E-AC-3 stereo output to near-total garbage despite exiting cleanly with the
right channel count, while FFmpeg decoded the identical file to a sane,
expected score. Left for its own investigation, not blocking here.)

Writes tests/golden/external-baseline/<leg>/{ffmpeg,dee}.<ac3|ec3> (the raw
bitstreams, committed) and one tests/golden/external-baseline/manifest.json
(the numbers CI reads). Bump BASELINE_VERSION by hand before rerunning this
to regenerate the baseline against a new DEE/FFmpeg release - it is the
only marker distinguishing one baseline generation from the next in a PR
diff.

Known issue: DEE's two 5.1 legs (ac3-51-448, eac3-51-256) score as
"unverified" rather than a number - see UNVERIFIED_DEE_LEGS below. This
installed DEE build (v6.5.4-dme+b56bc97e) reproducibly drops the Ls
(surround-left) channel's content for a discrete 6-channel 5.1 input,
confirmed with a per-channel tone probe: the silence is locked to channel
index 3 regardless of what content is placed there (swapping which
frequency sits in Ls vs Rs moves the silence with the *position*, not the
content), independent of WAV-vs-raw-PCM input, dd-vs-ddp codec, and the
surround_90deg_phase_shift flag. This is DEE's own behavior, not a bug in
this script or in ac3forge - the stereo E-AC-3 leg (no Ls channel to hit
this) scores DEE fine (33.32 dB SNR, sane and comparable to FFmpeg's own
32.81 dB at the same bitrate). The dee.ac3/dee.ec3 bitstreams are still
written and committed for the 5.1 legs, so re-scoring is free once this is
understood or a newer DEE build is available.

Usage (repo root, after building ac3cli):  python tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py
Set AC3CLI to override the ac3cli binary, same as quality_race.py.
