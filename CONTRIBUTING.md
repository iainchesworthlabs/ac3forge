# Contributing to ac3forge

## Build and test

Setup is in [docs/building.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/building.md). The short form, from any shell (a Developer PowerShell is not required — see that page):

```bash
cmake --preset config-windows-msvc-debug && cmake --build --preset build-windows-msvc-debug && ctest --preset test-windows-msvc-debug
```

There is no bare `debug` preset — swap `windows-msvc` for whichever platform/compiler fragment matches your machine (`windows-llvm`, `linux-gcc`, `linux-llvm`, `linux-gcc-arm64`, `linux-llvm-arm64`, `macos-llvm`).

Everything must pass before you push. There are no known-failing tests and no skips; if
something fails, that is your change or a genuine regression, not noise.

## Branches and pull requests

The branch model is trunk-based: `main` is the only long-lived branch, and every topic branch
merges straight into it — there is no separate integration branch to land on first. Topic
branches are named `<type>/<short-name>`, with `<type>` one of `feature` or `bugfix` (a hotfix
is just a `bugfix/*` branch — there is no separate hotfix flow) — CI's `Branch Name` check
enforces `^(feature|bugfix)/[a-z0-9._-]+$` on every PR, and its error message points back to
this file.

PRs target `main`. To merge, a PR must pass the required checks: `Branch Name`, the `CI Status`
aggregate (every required CI job — the build/test matrix, clang-tidy, coverage, the
FFmpeg-oracle validation and the rest), CodeQL's `Analyze (C++)`, and the `Scan dependency diff`
dependency review; a merge queue serializes landing when several PRs are ready at once (see
[.github/branch-protection.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/.github/branch-protection.md)
for the full required-check list and the merge-queue rationale). Releases are tags cut directly
from `main` — see [docs/releasing.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/releasing.md).

## The clean-room rule

This is the constraint the whole project rests on. Breaking it makes the code unusable.

- Every table and algorithm is transcribed from the published standard — ATSC A/52:2018, or
  for the object layer ETSI TS 103 420 and TS 102 366 — with its section or table number cited
  in a comment.
- Open-source encoders (FFmpeg, Aften, anything else) may be consulted for **architecture
  lessons only**. Never transcribe code. The spec contains every table, so there is never a
  need to.
- One exception, normative by construction: TS 103 420 ships its JOC Huffman tables *as* a C
  file in its companion archive. That file is the standard, not an implementation of it.

If you cannot cite where something came from, it does not go in.

## Repository layout

**`src/` is the installable library; `apps/` consumes it, never the reverse.** `src/forge` is
the codec itself; `apps/{cli,gui,wasm,android}` are its consumers. Nothing under `src/` may
depend on anything under `apps/`.

**The `ac3/` header prefix marks a dependency on `ac3::forge`, not just anything codec-adjacent.**
A module installs its public headers under `include/ac3/<name>/` exactly when it depends on or
extends `ac3::forge`'s own model: `forge` itself (`ac3/core`, `ac3/encoder`, ...), `admbridge`
(`ac3/admbridge`), `audio` (`ac3/audio`), `signing` (`ac3/signing`). A bare `include/<name>/`
(no `ac3/` prefix) marks a module as deliberately codec-blind: `ac3adm` (ADM/BW64 file parsing),
`matroska`, `mp4`, `mpegts` (container muxing) — none of these know AC-3, E-AC-3 or Atmos exist,
and should stay that way.

The one deliberate exception is `capi`: it installs under `include/ac3forge_c/`, not `ac3/`,
even though it depends on the codec directly (it wraps `ac3::forge_static`). The `ac3/` tree is
a C++ namespace; `capi` is a C-callable surface, and a C or non-C++ consumer has no reason to
see, or accidentally `#include`, a C++ header. Don't read "not under `ac3/`" as "codec-blind"
here — it's a different axis (language surface, not dependency) that happens to look similar.

**One subdirectory per platform audio backend, selected by CMake, never `#ifdef`.**
`src/audio/src/backend/{alsa,pipewire,android,macos,posix,windows}` — adding a backend means a
new directory and a new CMake guard, not a new preprocessor branch. There are zero
`#ifdef`-based platform branches anywhere in `src/`; keep it that way.

**A leading underscore on a workflow file means "reusable, not directly triggered."**
`.github/workflows/_build.yml` and `_toolchain-versions.yml` are `workflow_call` targets invoked
by `ci.yml` and `release.yml`; every other workflow file responds to a real GitHub event
(`pull_request`, `push`, a schedule) on its own.

## Code conventions

**C++23, and use it.** `std::expected` for recoverable failure, `std::span` for borrowed
sequences, `fmt::print`/`fmt::format` for output — not the `std::print`/`std::format`
equivalents, since NDK r26's bundled libc++ has no `<format>` at all (see
`docs/platforms/android.md`) and {fmt} sidesteps the gap outright rather than routing around it
file by file — designated initializers for configuration structs, `constexpr` and `consteval` for
anything computable at build time. (A handful of older call sites already used C-style
`%`-specifier output before this convention existed; those keep their existing format strings but
go through `fmt::printf`/`<fmt/printf.h>`, not `std::printf`, for the same NDK reason.) The
window tables and several spec-table self-checks are
`consteval` — a table that is wrong fails the build rather than a test.

**One exception, for reading rather than writing.** {fmt} only formats *out*; it has no
`from_chars`-equivalent for parsing text *into* a `double`, and `<charconv>`'s own **floating-point**
`from_chars` is unavailable both on the NDK's bundled libc++ and at the macOS wheel's deployment
target (`'from_chars' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 26.0`) — the **integer** overloads are
fine everywhere and are used directly. Code that has to parse a decimal from user- or
file-supplied text therefore goes through `strtod` instead (`src/forge/src/encoder/plan.cpp`,
`encoder/assignment.cpp`, `src/forge/src/oba/scene_text.hpp`). Neither gap shows up on a Windows,
Linux or Homebrew-macOS build, so the CI legs that catch it are Android (Shield) and Build wheels
(macos-latest).

**Warnings are errors.** `ac3::warnings` is linked privately into every first-party target,
including `examples/`. That includes `-Wsign-conversion` and its MSVC equivalents, which in
this codebase means a lot of explicit `static_cast<std::size_t>` on indices. Add the cast; do
not suppress the warning.

**No exceptions for stream-level failure.** A malformed bitstream, an out-of-range
configuration or a missing file are all expected conditions and return `std::expected`. A
programming error — the wrong number of samples in a frame — may assert.

**No allocation on the render path.** `spatial::BedRenderer::render_block` and the capture
ring are called at block rate; allocation there is a bug even when it works.

**`.clang-format` is checked in.** Run it.

## Comments explain why, with a citation

The single most useful thing in this codebase is a comment saying which part of the standard a
line implements and what would go wrong otherwise. Comments that restate the code are noise;
comments that record a decision are the reason the code can be maintained at all.

Good:

```cpp
// A/52 §5.4.4.1 puts aux user data at the END of the auxbits field, immediately
// before auxdatal, "so a decoder can find and unpack the auxdatal user bits
// without knowing the value of nauxbits" - nauxbits being unknowable until the
// whole frame has been decoded. So the container is not appended after the
// padding; the padding is what gets pushed in front of it.
```

That says what the spec requires, quotes the clause, and explains the non-obvious consequence.
A reader who wonders why padding comes first has their answer without opening the PDF.

Not useful:

```cpp
// Write the aux data.
```

Where behaviour is deliberately narrower than the standard, say so and say why — see the
decoder's header for the pattern. "Deliberately unsupported (clean errors, not wrong audio)"
is a design statement; a silent gap is a bug waiting to be found by someone else.

## Validation discipline

Two rules, both learned the hard way. Ignore either and your tests will pass while the code is
broken.

### Test with real audio, from frame 1 onward

**Silence is not a test signal.** With all SNR offsets at zero, §7.2.2.1.1 defines an all-zero
bit allocation: no mantissa data exists and the frame is pure syntax. A silent frame therefore
exercises almost none of the encoder, and passes whatever you have done to the parts it skips.

**Frame 0 is not a test either.** The MDCT overlap buffer starts at zero, so the first frame's
transform is a special case. Frame-layout errors, overlap-state errors and rate-accumulator
errors all show up from frame 2 onward and not before.

So: at least three frames, of material with actual content. Different content per channel when
the test is about channel order or separation — identical tones in two channels cannot
distinguish "the surrounds were overwritten correctly" from "the dependent substream was
ignored".

### Prove the test can fail

A regression test that has never failed is a test you have no evidence about. After writing
one, **reintroduce the bug it is meant to catch and confirm the test fails.** Then revert.

This is not optional ceremony. Several tests in this repo would have passed against the bug
they were written for, and were only fixed because someone checked.

## Oracles

Ranked by how much they prove. Prefer the strongest one available for what you are changing.

1. **The in-repo decoder.** Fully normative and sharing the encoder's core. Strongest for
   anything both sides implement, and the *only* oracle for 7.1.4.
2. **FFmpeg.** External and independent. Always strict-decode:
   `ffmpeg -v error -xerror -err_detect crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode -i out.ac3 -f null -`.
   Without `-err_detect`, FFmpeg conceals errors and a broken stream looks fine. `-xerror` is not
   optional either, and is easy to miss: `-err_detect` alone only controls what the decoder
   treats as an error *internally* (concealing a bad frame and moving on) - it does not, by
   itself, change ffmpeg's own exit code, which stays 0 even after a logged CRC mismatch.
   `-xerror` ("exit on error") is the flag that turns a detected error into a failing process,
   which is what every script here checking only the exit code (all of them) actually needs.

   The in-repo decoder also reads Annex E coupling, spectral extension and AHT now, so FFmpeg is
   a second, independent check on them rather than the only one — except at 7.1.4, where point 1
   above is still the only decoder either way. Two separate CI mechanisms use FFmpeg, answering
   different questions:

   - **`ffmpeg-validate`** (Linux-only, this job): *correctness* across the full option space.
     `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh`'s FFmpeg strict-decode checks for conformance,
     `tools/checks/check_drc.py` and `tools/checks/check_coupling.py`/`check_coupling_level.py` for metadata
     that only a discriminating decode can confirm, and `tools/ci/quality_race.py ci` for a numeric
     SNR/LSD floor per E-AC-3 tool variant. Running any of these locally needs `ffmpeg` on `PATH`
     and, for the Python ones, `AC3CLI` (or `--cli`) pointed at your build's `ac3cli`.
   - **The gold-reference gate** (`tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh`, every platform leg):
     *quality* and cross-platform reproducibility on one fixed sample - does ac3cli's own decoder
     agree with FFmpeg's, by SNR, on every compiler this project builds with. See
     [docs/building.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/building.md#gold-reference-correctness-gate).

   The same job also runs `tools/checks/check_matrix_coverage.py`, which asks a different question: not
   "is the output correct" but "does anything exercise this at all". It reads the CLI's own
   canonical option lists (its usage text, and the "unknown layout"/"unknown tool set" messages a
   bad argument hits) and fails if a layout, Annex E tool token or command the CLI accepts is
   never exercised by `run_codec_matrix.sh`. Most of those are presence checks — the token has to
   appear somewhere in the script — but Annex E tool tokens are read only from the tool sets the
   matrix actually encodes with, after a token that appeared only as an unrelated option's *value*
   produced a false pass. So a new layout, tool token or command needs a matching matrix entry in
   the same change, or CI says so — see that script's own header for what it does and does not
   catch.

   Both of those walk a *hand-enumerated* list of command lines against one bootstrap tone, so
   neither has any notion of option *combinations* or of the input material. The same job's
   `tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py` step covers what that leaves: random legal encoder
   configurations crossed with adversarial PCM whose character changes part-way through a frame,
   every resulting stream held against both decoders. It exists because the `deltbaie` defect
   (`deltbaie = 0` means "retain", not "no delta") produced streams both decoders reject and
   escaped every gate above — reaching it needed an input *shape*, not an option combination.
   Bounded to two minutes per pull request; `fuzz.yml`'s `encoder-space-nightly` runs it deeper.
   Every failure prints a case seed that regenerates the exact input (`--replay <seed>`).
3. **Somebody else's bitstreams.** Points 1 and 2 both decode something this project encoded.
   Reading a stream *nobody here produced* is a different question, and the one that found five
   Annex E parsing defects in a single sitting once anything actually asked it. Two tiers, both
   automated: `tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh` decodes the six committed Dolby Encoding
   Engine and FFmpeg streams in `tests/golden/external-baseline/` on every gold-reference leg,
   and the nightly `Interop` workflow runs `tools/checks/verify_fate_interop.py` over eight
   SHA-256-pinned commercial-encoder excerpts fetched from FFmpeg's FATE archive. Reach for this
   one whenever you touch decoder syntax the encoder here never emits — and read
   [docs/verification.md](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/ac3forge/verification/#third-party-bitstreams)
   first, because there are no free AC-3 or E-AC-3 conformance vectors and this is the
   substitute, not the real thing.
4. **The Python references in `tools/`.** Independent transcriptions of the same spec text.
   Weaker than a decoder — two transcriptions can share a misreading — but they catch slips a
   self-consistent round trip cannot.
5. **Dolby's Reference Player and Media Encoder**, for object-layer syntax.

**Object reconstruction has none of the four.** Dolby's tooling above verifies the object
layer's *syntax*, not its audio: that decoder gates object decoding on a keyed authenticity tag
this project ships no key for, so it renders these streams as their 5.1 bed, and FFmpeg
implements no JOC reconstruction at all. Nothing outside this repository can produce an
independent object decode of an ac3forge stream. What exists instead is a self-consistency
series with real resolution — `tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s `objects` mode scores a committed
five-object scene per object per rate on every push, trended at [Object quality
trend](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/ac3forge/object-quality-trend/). If you are changing
`ac3::oba::joc` or `ac3::oba`, run it before and after and put both numbers in the commit message;
it takes seconds and it is the only quality signal that layer has.

Neither decoder covers everything, and the gaps do not overlap: see the [verification-gap
table](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/ac3forge/verification/#where-the-oracles-dont-reach). If your change lands in a cell with no oracle, say so in
the commit message and cover it bit-by-bit instead.

## Documentation

The examples in [docs/library/](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/library/index.md) are excerpts from programs in
[`examples/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/tree/main/examples), which are build targets and `ctest` entries. If you change a public
API, update the example — the build will tell you if you forget. Do not add a snippet to the
docs that is not backed by a compiled file.

If you add a capability or find a new limitation, the tables in
[docs/index.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/index.md) ("What it
does" / "What it does not do") and, for oracle coverage specifically,
[docs/verification.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/verification.md)
are the authority and must be updated with it. README.md's own summary of the same material
should stay a summary, not grow back into a second copy. [docs/history.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge/blob/main/docs/history.md) is a
record of past work and is not maintained against the current state.

## Commits

**Never use a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** This is absolute, and applies whatever tooling you
are using.

Write the subject as what the change does and, where it fits, why — the existing log is the
style guide:

```
cli: one command table, so an argv index cannot be quietly wrong
integration: drop the duplicate AC-3 channel map
```

Reference the spec section in the body when the change is a spec question. If a commit fixes
something an oracle found, say which oracle.

## Reporting a problem

Include the exact command, the stream if you can attach one, and what the oracle said. For a
decode problem, say which decoder — "it does not play" is not actionable when the in-repo
decoder and FFmpeg refuse different, documented things.
