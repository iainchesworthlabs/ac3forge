// Streams a recording's encoded frames to their destination as they are
// produced, for the containers whose format allows it - which is what turns
// a take's memory footprint from "the whole session" (~3.4 MB per minute at
// 448 kbps, unbounded until Stop) into one frame, and puts the take's bytes
// on disk continuously instead of only at a clean stop, so a crash an hour
// in no longer loses the hour.
//
// The four containers here are exactly the streamable ones: a bare
// elementary stream appends; Matroska streams via matroska::Writer (EBML's
// own unknown-size Segment pattern - the file differs from the one-shot
// mux()'s by exactly that, as that class's comment describes); MPEG-TS via
// mpegts::Writer (whose bytes are contract-identical to mux()'s); the
// IEC 61937 WAV carrier via per-frame wrapping into
// ac3::io::WavPcm16StreamWriter, whose closed file is byte-identical to
// write_wav_pcm16_raw over the same bursts. MP4 and fMP4 are deliberately
// absent: moov/stco need every frame's final offset, and the dec3/dac3
// codec-config box needs a bitstream scan - the accumulate-then-mux shape
// in EncoderController::writeOutput IS their streaming-less design (see
// mp4's own "deliberately no monolithic Writer" record), so the recording
// loop keeps that shape for them.
//
// Qt-free on purpose: everything here is std:: and the container libraries,
// so tests' plain C++ test can drive it against the one-shot writers without
// a QML engine in the room. Errors come back as the user-facing strings
// EncoderController's status line already shows - empty means fine.
//
// Shared by BOTH front ends since roadmap IO9, which is why it lives in
// apps/common rather than apps/gui: `ac3cli record`/`ac3cli live` write their
// takes through this same class, so a CLI take and a GUI take of the same
// container are the same bytes produced the same way, and the crash-safety
// and bounded-memory properties above are one implementation rather than
// two. Neither app owns it; both compile it in directly (there is no
// library target to link, the same arrangement the CLI's own support.cpp
// has).
