// Object signing is no longer a build-variant toggle. The signer (ac3::signing)
// is committed and always compiled; whether the app actually signs is decided
// at runtime by whether a `signing.key` asset is present (see
// shield_signing_hook.hpp). That asset is written into src/main/assets/ from a
// CI secret at build time (.github/workflows/_build.yml) and is gitignored, so
// this committed file always builds the safe, unsigned bed51 app unless a key
// asset was provisioned alongside it. See docs/concepts/object-signing.md.

// Release-keystore signing, wired to environment variables rather than
// local.properties: CI (release.yml -> _build.yml's build-android job)
// decodes the ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 secret to a runner-temp file and
// exports these four before invoking assembleRelease. Absent locally and
// on ordinary CI (secrets aren't exposed there, and assembleDebug never
// reads a release signingConfig anyway) - releaseSigningAvailable gates
// both whether the config is created at all and which one `release` uses,
// so every build path degrades to the debug keystore exactly as before
// this was wired up, rather than failing when the four env vars are unset.
