// anonymous namespace mirroring ac3cli's own measure_qc_ac3/measure_qc_eac3,
// see that file's header comment) can build one without needing member
// access. Presentation (formatting, delta-against-a-preset) happens only in
// QcController::programmes() itself - the same "store the fact, compute the
// display" split every other *Meta/*Model getter in this app follows.
//
// One instance per programme measured - one for every layout except 1+1 dual
// mono, which is two (Ch1, Ch2): §E1.3 makes them unrelated, unmixed
// programmes sharing one syncframe rather than a single soundfield BS.1770
// could measure as one, the same reason apps/cli/main.cpp's own
// QcProgrammeResult exists in this same shape. Every field carries its own
// default member initializer for the same -Wmissing-field-initializers
// reason that type's own header comment gives - every construction here is a
// partial designated initializer too.

// The QObject facade for roadmap C3 — "the same QC verification in the GUI".
//
// This is deliberately NOT a member of EncoderController. Every other panel
// in this app configures and runs an ENCODE: a source is loaded, a plan is
// built, the plan is applied. QC is the opposite shape entirely — an
// ALREADY-ENCODED file the user already has is opened, decoded and measured
// against its own embedded claims, with no plan, no source and no encoder
// involved anywhere in the path. Folding this into EncoderController would
// mean every one of its 700-odd lines of encode-workflow state carries a
// second, unrelated "what does this arbitrary file already contain" concern
// alongside it - see encoder_controller.hpp's own header comment on why
// nothing here should disagree with what ac3cli would say, which is exactly
// the property a bolted-on second concern risks breaking first. QcController
// mirrors `ac3cli qc` (apps/cli/main.cpp's run_qc/measure_qc_ac3/
// measure_qc_eac3) instead: reads a file, decodes it with the same
// ac3::FrameDecoder/ac3::Eac3Decoder EncoderController's own monitor path
// already uses, measures it with ac3::meta::LoudnessMeter (the same meter
// `dialnorm=auto` uses) and reports it against ac3::meta::qc's three named
// delivery presets. See docs/gui/qc.md for where this surfaces in the
// window and why.
