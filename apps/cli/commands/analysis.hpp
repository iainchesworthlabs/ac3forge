// The measurement/transform commands that need no audio hardware: qc, levels, loudness, and
// spdif/unspdif. spdif is not itself a measurement command, but by this point in the H4 split it sits
// textually adjacent to loudness/levels/qc (the audio-hardware and container commands that used
// to separate them have already moved to their own files) - grouped here by that physical
// adjacency rather than forced into a cleaner-sounding but artificial category, the same rationale
// commands/containers.hpp gives for excluding spdif from itself.
// Split out of main.cpp as part of the repo-structure review's H4 monolith split.
