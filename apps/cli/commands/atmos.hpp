// The Atmos/object-layer commands: two synthetic generators (a built-in orbit, and one driven by
// a hand-authored keyframe file), one real-material encoder (every source channel becomes an
// object), one ADM BWF reader (roadmap B1 phase 3, the ac3adm/admbridge integration), and the
// one that goes the other way - taking an object layer back out of a finished stream. Split
// out of main.cpp as part of the repo-structure review's H4 monolith split.

// so no two of them share a direction for long - which is the condition under
// which JOC can actually pull them apart again. Heights are what makes this
// worth doing at all: a 5.1 bed cannot carry them, and the object metadata can.
