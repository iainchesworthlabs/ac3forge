// The CLI-wide support layer: option/metadata parsing, path/stdio conventions, frame and WAV I/O,
// and level reporting shared by nearly every command in main.cpp's kCommands table. Split out of
// main.cpp (which used to define all of this in its own anonymous namespace) as the first step of
// the repo-structure review's H4 monolith split - see that review for why, and main.cpp's own
// command-table comment for the design these helpers serve.
//
// Everything here has external linkage (namespace ac3cli, not main.cpp's old anonymous namespace)
// because it is now called from a different translation unit. A few helpers that are genuinely
// private to one function's own implementation (parse_double, to_bytes, write_wav_f32_arg) stay
// out of this header entirely and live in an anonymous namespace inside support.cpp instead,
// preserving the original "internal unless something else needs it" default.
//
// Everything about layouts, coding tools and metadata itself lives in ac3::plan, so the GUI
// cannot mean something different by "514" or by "all" than this does. What is here is argument
// shape, validation and printing - Options carries plan::Metadata verbatim rather than a second,
