# fuzz/generate-seeds.sh - grow a fuzzing corpus from ac3forge's own valid
# output, by running ac3cli across the layout/codec/tool matrix this project
# already supports. Cheaper and more representative than hand-written corpus
# files: every seed here is a real, self-consistent stream this project can
# actually produce, so a fuzzer's mutations start from "almost valid" rather
# than from nothing.
#
# Needs a built ac3cli. Any working configuration will do: this generates
# plain valid streams, not instrumented ones, so it needs neither Clang nor
# sanitizers. The Windows MSVC leg is what gets used in practice, for no
# better reason than that it is the one already built on the development
# host - every other leg builds clean too.

# itself worth starting from - unspdif clamps a data chunk to what the file
# actually holds, and that clamp is exactly the kind of thing to mutate.
