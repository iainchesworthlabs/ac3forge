# Fuzzing

libFuzzer harnesses over every place ac3forge parses externally-supplied
binary data. This is the codec's natural attack surface: its whole job is
decoding bitstreams whose structure it cannot control, and the project has
already had one real bug in this class - commit `8386c8f` fixed a decoder
that shifted by an unvalidated exponent, walked outside the range the
reconstruction code assumed by a malformed differential chain, and hit
undefined behaviour on hostile input. It was found by a one-off manual
adversarial audit; this directory makes that kind of input-shape exploration
continuous and automatic instead.

## Why Clang only

libFuzzer (`-fsanitize=fuzzer`) is an LLVM built-in. GCC and MSVC do not ship
it, so everything here requires upstream Clang - specifically the
`linux-llvm` / `macos-llvm` toolchain this project already has presets for
(`windows-llvm` is clang-cl, whose libFuzzer support on Windows this project
has never exercised, so it is deliberately out of scope; see
`fuzz/CMakeLists.txt`'s `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_FRONTEND_VARIANT` guard).

`.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh` installs the Clang compiler itself
but not `libclang-rt-<ver>-dev` (the ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer runtime archives):
none of `ci.yml`'s other Clang legs link a sanitizer, so none of them have
ever needed it. `fuzz.yml` installs it as an explicit extra step; a local
Debian/Ubuntu run needs `apt-get install libclang-rt-21-dev` (or your
distro's equivalent) before `fuzz/run.sh` will link.

## `-Werror` is on for this build too

This build once opted out of `ac3::warnings`: `AC3FORGE_BUILD_FUZZERS` skipped
linking it into `ac3forge`, on the stated assumption that the codebase carried
roughly sixteen sign-conversion and double-promotion sites that only the
Windows MSVC leg had ever been held to, and that clearing them belonged to the
cross-platform porting task rather than to fuzzing.

That number was never measured, and it was wrong. Building the harnesses with
`ac3::warnings` linked in, under Clang 21 with the full set
(`-Werror -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wdouble-promotion -Wold-style-cast`
and the rest) alongside ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer, produces **zero** warnings - the
other legs had gone green in the meantime and taken the debt with them. The
exemption was removed rather than re-justified, so `ac3forge` now compiles
under one warning set in every configuration, this one included.

All harness executables link `ac3::warnings` too, and had no warnings of
their own either. They need to name it explicitly: `ac3forge` links it
`PRIVATE`, so the flags govern the library's own sources and do not propagate
to anything downstream of it.

That the set is genuinely live, and not merely listed on the command line, was
checked twice - once by injecting a deliberate sign-conversion and double-
promotion into a library source, once into a harness source - confirming the
fuzz build fails on both in each case.

## Status at the commit that added this

Like `ci.yml`'s own leg-status table, this is a point-in-time result, not a
standing guarantee - re-run it yourself rather than trusting an old number.

Two full bounded passes ran locally before this landed (Docker: `ubuntu:26.04`
+ LLVM 21, matching CI's `linux-llvm` leg, since this was developed on a
Windows host with no native libFuzzer). The first pass used a Debug build and
was clean but showed pathologically low throughput on the decode harnesses
(2-3 exec/s); switching to `RelWithDebInfo` - libFuzzer's own advice, build
with optimizations on even under sanitizers - fixed that. Numbers below are
the second pass, 180s/harness:

| Harness             | Executions | Corpus grown to  | Result |
|----------------------|-----------:|------------------|--------|
| `fuzz_scan`          |      ~25.9M | 116 files / 1.0MB | clean  |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`    |       3,011 | 184 files / 5.8MB | clean  |
| `fuzz_eac3_decode`   |       2,796 | 166 files / 7.6MB | clean  |
| `fuzz_wav_read`      |      13,370 | 56 files / 14MB   | clean  |

No crash, hang, or sanitizer report across ~45M total executions between the
two passes; `fuzz/regressions/` is empty as of this commit. `fuzz_scan`'s exec
count dwarfs the decode harnesses' because a format-sniff is orders of
magnitude cheaper than a real IMDCT-and-bit-allocation decode - expected, not
a sign anything is under-tested relative to its own cost.

## Entry points covered

| Harness              | Calls                                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fuzz_scan`            | `ac3::io::scan` - format-sniffing before any decoder commits to a layout |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`      | `ac3::split_frames` + `ac3::FrameDecoder::decode_frame`, one decoder across all frames, the way `ac3cli decode` drives it |
| `fuzz_eac3_decode`     | `ac3::split_access_units` + `ac3::Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit` (which calls `decode_substream` internally), the way `ac3cli decode` drives it for E-AC-3 |
| `fuzz_wav_read`        | `ac3::io::read_wav` - a realistic input too (a truncated or hand-edited WAV), not only an adversarial one |
| `fuzz_iec61937_unwrap` | `ac3::iec61937::BurstReader` + `unwrap_stream` - IEC 61937 burst de-framing, driven the way `ac3cli unspdif` drives it. The input is by definition off a wire (an S/PDIF or HDMI capture), and `Pd` states a length the parser must not believe past its data type's repetition period. Pushed as two chunks split at a mutation-chosen point, so the state machine's carry-across-a-chunk-boundary paths are reachable |

`matroska::` was checked and has no read/demux path - `matroska::mux()` only
ever produces bytes from frames already in hand, so there is nothing to fuzz
there. `ac3::io::read_wav` takes a path rather than a byte span, so
`fuzz_wav_read` round-trips libFuzzer's buffer through a scratch file
(`/dev/shm` when available) before calling it - the one unavoidable step
beyond calling the real function directly, since there is no in-memory
overload to call instead.

## Differential mode (roadmap G3)

`fuzz_differential_ac3_decode` and `fuzz_differential_eac3_decode` drive the
exact same decode paths as `fuzz_ac3_decode`/`fuzz_eac3_decode` above, but
instead of (in addition to - a crash is still a crash) only checking for a
crash or sanitizer trip, they decode the SAME mutated bytes a second time
with FFmpeg and diff the resulting PCM against this project's own decode.
`fuzz/differential_oracle.hpp` has the full mechanism and reasoning; the
short version:

- Both decoders have to accept the ENTIRE input - every frame/access unit,
  one unchanging acmod/sample rate throughout - before FFmpeg is even
  invoked. The overwhelming majority of mutations get rejected immediately
  by this project's own decoder (bad sync word, bad CRC, a reserved field),
  and none of those are worth a real FFmpeg process.
- A **PCM mismatch is only reported as a divergence when both decoders
  accepted the input and produced comparably-shaped audio.** FFmpeg's own
  error-concealment on a mutated (i.e. potentially malformed) frame can
  legitimately differ from this project's spec-strict decode - that proves
  nothing about which one is right, so it is treated as "no oracle for this
  one," the same stance `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh` already takes for the
  Annex E tool combinations FFmpeg has no reading of at all (enhanced
  coupling, transient pre-noise processing, a second dependent substream/
  7.1.4 - see `docs/verification.md`'s "Where the oracles don't reach").
- Where a comparison IS eligible, the floor - `kMinAgreementDb = 6.0` in
  `fuzz/differential_oracle.hpp` - is deliberately loose relative to what a
  clean, non-fuzzed stream actually measures at (`docs/verification.md`:
  float32-precision parity for the plain path, 98+ dB for coupling/spectral
  extension, 62-89 dB for AHT). It started from
  `tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh`'s own `CPLBNDSTRCE0_MIN_SNR_DB=15`
  precedent - this project's one existing floor for "two decodes of a
  bitstream neither side controls" - and was then calibrated down to 6 dB
  after `fuzz/measure-agreement.sh` found committed seeds that legitimately
  measure below 15 dB (real, unmutated content whose bap-0 reconstruction
  FFmpeg dithers and this decoder zeros).
- `fuzz/measure-agreement.sh` is the calibration method behind that floor:
  it runs every committed seed through the differential harnesses in
  measure-only mode and reports the worst-channel SNR each one lands on.
  Re-run it after adding seed content, and after any change to
  `compare_pcm`'s own alignment/silence-skip logic - a new corner of
  legitimate decoder disagreement needs the floor reconsidered, not
  assumed.

Because every comparable input spawns a real FFmpeg process, these two
harnesses are much slower per-exec than every other harness here and are
NOT in `fuzz/run.sh`'s default target list or in the `fuzz-regress`/
`fuzz-short`/`fuzz-nightly` CI jobs - they get their own job,
`fuzz-differential` (see the CI section below), and need `ffmpeg` on PATH to
compare anything at all (silently a no-op otherwise, same as running without
`ffmpeg` installed locally). They share their crash-only siblings' seed
corpora rather than duplicating those files (`fuzz/run.sh`'s
`seed_source_for`) - same bytes, same decode path, just with an extra
comparison bolted on.

## The other direction: the encoder's input space

Everything above mutates an already-encoded bitstream. That answers "does the
DECODER survive corrupt input", and it is the whole of what this directory
covered for a long time. The mirror-image question - "does the ENCODER, driven
across its own legal configuration space by adversarial but perfectly valid
audio, ever emit a stream a decoder refuses" - is
**`tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py`**, and nothing here asks it.

It is not a libFuzzer target and not part of `fuzz/run.sh`: it drives the real
`ac3cli`, so it needs the ordinary CLI build rather than this directory's
sanitizer/libFuzzer toolchain, and its failure signal is a decoder refusing a
stream rather than a sanitizer report. Per case it draws a random legal
encoder configuration (layout, bitrate, coupling, DRC, heavy compression,
dialnorm, downmix levels, forward-MDCT path), draws adversarial PCM built per
256-sample BLOCK so a frame's character can change part-way through it,
encodes, and then decodes the result with BOTH `ac3cli decode` and FFmpeg's
strict decode - the same invocation `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh` uses. A
refusal from either fails the case, with one arbitrated exception: when only
FFmpeg's default invocation refuses and the same bytes decode cleanly under
`-f ac3` with every error check kept, libavformat's container *guess* failed
rather than the stream, and the case counts as "misprobed" instead - measured
and explained in the script's note above `MIN_STREAM_BYTES` (large syncframes
can lose FFmpeg's probe-window race to the MPEG-PS prober no matter how long
the stream is).

Why it exists: PR #186 fixed an encoder defect (`deltbaie == 0` means "retain
the previous block's delta bit allocation", not "no delta") that produced
streams both decoders reject, and it escaped ctest, the codec matrix, the
gold-reference gate and every job in this file. Reaching it needs dense
harmonic content followed by digital silence inside one frame - an input
SHAPE, not an option combination, which is why enumerating options more
thoroughly would never have found it. The harness finds it in seconds; that
was verified by reverting the fix and running it (see the file's own header).

```bash
AC3CLI=build/config-linux-llvm/bin/ac3cli python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --seconds 120
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --check-envelope      # re-measure the rate floors it draws from
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --replay <case-seed>  # rerun one exact failing case
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --regressions         # replay every recorded past failure
```

Every case is a pure function of one 64-bit case seed, printed beside any
failure, so a random run stays fully reproducible after the fact. Failing
inputs are kept under `fuzz-encoder-artifacts/` (gitignored, and regenerable
from the seed).

Scope: AC-3 `encode` only. E-AC-3's own configuration space - the Annex E tool
tokens, VBR, the wider layouts - is a real remaining gap, deliberately left
open rather than half-covered.

## Running locally

```bash
# One-time: any Clang 18+ with libFuzzer works; CI pins LLVM 21 the same way
# ci.yml's linux-llvm leg does (.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh).
fuzz/run.sh                    # build, then run every default-list harness for 60s each
fuzz/run.sh fuzz_scan          # just one harness
AC3FORGE_FUZZ_SECONDS=600 fuzz/run.sh   # a deeper local run
fuzz/run.sh regress            # replay seeds + regressions, no mutation (fast)
fuzz/run.sh minimize fuzz_scan fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_scan-crash-<hash>

# Differential harnesses need `ffmpeg` on PATH and are named explicitly -
# see "Differential mode" above for why they're not in the default list.
fuzz/run.sh run fuzz_differential_ac3_decode fuzz_differential_eac3_decode
```

On Windows, run this from WSL or inside a Linux container - there is no
libFuzzer under MSVC or clang-cl here. The commands used to develop this
directory ran inside `docker run ubuntu:26.04` with the repo bind-mounted,
which is exactly what `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`'s containers do.

See `fuzz/run.sh --help`-equivalent (its own header comment) for the full
environment-variable list.

## Seed corpus

`fuzz/seeds/<harness>/` is a curated, committed bootstrap corpus generated
from ac3forge's own valid output - `fuzz/generate-seeds.sh` drives `ac3cli`
across the layout/codec/Annex-E-tool matrix this project already supports
(every layout token, every tool combination, both codecs, silence and real
audio, coupled and uncoupled, Atmos objects and the bed51 fallback) and
collects the resulting streams. Starting mutation from real, self-consistent
streams is what lets a fuzzer's mutations explore "almost valid" input
instead of spending its budget on bytes that get rejected before line one of
the parser.

Regenerate it with:

```bash
AC3CLI_BIN=build/config-windows-msvc-debug/bin/ac3cli.exe fuzz/generate-seeds.sh
```

(Any *working* `ac3cli` build does - this only needs it to produce valid
streams, not to run instrumented. The MSVC leg is the practical choice on a
Windows host simply because it is the one already built there.)

`fuzz/seeds/` is intentionally small (a few MB) and committed to the repo.
`fuzz/corpus/` - what a real mutation run *grows* into over its time budget -
is not: it is regenerable from the seeds plus a mutation budget, and libFuzzer
corpora can reach hundreds of MB, which does not belong in git history. It is
gitignored; `fuzz/run.sh` creates it on demand.

## When a fuzzer finds something

1. libFuzzer minimizes automatically (or run `fuzz/run.sh minimize <target>
   <path>` on a saved artifact).
2. The minimized input is added to `fuzz/regressions/<harness>/` and
   committed - `fuzz/run.sh regress` (and `fuzz-regress` in CI) replays every
   file there on every run, so a fixed bug can never silently regress.
3. The underlying bug gets a real, spec-grounded fix in the library - never
   just enough to make the fuzzer stop finding it.
4. Before considering it fixed: check out the pre-fix commit and confirm the
   *original* minimized input actually reproduces the crash there. A
   regression test that was never shown to fail is not proof of anything.

## CI

`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`:

- `fuzz-regress` - replays `fuzz/seeds/` + `fuzz/regressions/` with no
  mutation, on every push/PR to `main`/`develop`. Seconds, not minutes, and
  not marked experimental: a failure here means a previously-fixed bug came
  back, which should always be loud.
- `fuzz-short` - a 60-second-per-harness mutation budget over the crash-only
  harnesses, push only (not pull_request, to keep PR turnaround unaffected).
- `fuzz-differential` - the same 60-second-per-harness mutation budget, push
  only, but over ONLY the two differential harnesses (see "Differential
  mode" above) - a separate job rather than folded into `fuzz-short` because
  it needs `ffmpeg` installed and is much slower per-exec (a real FFmpeg
  process per comparable input), so sharing a budget with the crash-only
  harnesses would have starved them of iterations. Also replays
  `fuzz/regressions/fuzz_differential_*` first, same shape as `fuzz-regress`.
- `fuzz-nightly` - a 10-minute-per-harness mutation budget on a daily
  schedule, plus `workflow_dispatch` with a configurable budget for an
  on-demand deeper run. Crash-only harnesses only - see `fuzz-differential`.
- `encoder-space-nightly` - the encoder input-space search above, on the same
  daily schedule and `workflow_dispatch`, with a 15-minute default budget.
  Shares none of the machinery of the other four (no libFuzzer, no sanitizer
  runtime, not in `fuzz/run.sh`): it builds the plain `linux-llvm` CLI with
  vcpkg and a pinned `ffmpeg`, the way `ci.yml`'s `ffmpeg-validate` job does.

The bounded per-PR counterpart to `encoder-space-nightly` is a step in
`ci.yml`'s `ffmpeg-validate` job (~2 minutes, plus the envelope check), not a
job in this file - everything it needs is already built and pinned there, and
unlike `fuzz-short` it runs on pull requests rather than push only, because it
is cheap enough relative to the job it rides on.

`fuzz-short`, `fuzz-differential` and `fuzz-nightly` run with
`continue-on-error: true`, the same convention `ci.yml` uses for its other
unproven legs: none has multiple clean fuzzing runs behind it yet. That is a
question of track record, and it is not settled by the build being
warnings-clean - a bounded mutation run can still surface something on any
given night. `fuzz-regress` is cheap enough to make a required
branch-protection check once it has proven itself - that is a repository
setting this file cannot declare on its own.

This is a bounded, time-boxed run, not continuous (OSS-Fuzz-style) fuzzing
infrastructure. That is a deliberate scope decision, not a limitation
somebody forgot to lift.
