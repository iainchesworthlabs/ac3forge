// Exclusive-mode IEC 61937 passthrough: hand already-packed AC-3 or E-AC-3
// bursts to an S/PDIF or HDMI endpoint so the AV receiver on the other end
// decodes them itself and lights its Dolby Digital / Dolby Digital Plus
// indicator.
//
// Exclusive mode is mandatory. In shared mode the Windows audio engine would
// treat the bursts as ordinary PCM and mix, resample or volume-scale them;
// any of those corrupts the bit pattern and the receiver hears static or
// loses lock. Exclusive mode hands the endpoint our bytes untouched.
//
// The burst packing itself lives in ac3::iec61937 (byte-exact against
// FFmpeg's spdif muxer, and for E-AC-3 also cross-checked against Microsoft's
// own IEC 61937 documentation); this is only delivery.
