// `baseline_a`/`baseline_b` are this block's shared enhanced coupling
// channel, already reconstructed via ecpl_channel_coefficients at (amp=1,
// angle=0) and (amp=1, angle=0.5) respectively, sliced to this band's own
// bins. Those two are enough to express what ANY (amp, angle) pair would
// reconstruct, because §3.5.5.4's reconstruction is linear in the complex
// gain g = amp * exp(i*pi*angle): reconstruction(g)[bin] = g_re *
// baseline_a[bin] + g_im * baseline_b[bin] (baseline_a is g at (1,0),
// baseline_b is g at (0,1) - the real and imaginary unit gains). Fitting
// (g_re, g_im) to minimize squared error against the channel's own real
// coefficients is therefore a plain 2-variable linear least squares, not an
// approximation - solved directly below rather than searched.
//
// Chaos does not admit the same closed form: §3.5.5.3 adds chaos*noise to
// the fitted angle independently PER BIN (a discontinuous effect, not
// another degree of freedom the linear model above can absorb). But
// ecpl_rand_notrans is a pure, deterministic function of (channel, bin) -
// the exact sequence the decoder will use - so instead of estimating chaos
// from some statistical proxy for phase spread, this searches the 8 legal
// codes directly: for each, reconstruct the band exactly as the decoder
// would with that code and the already-fitted angle, and keep whichever
// reconstruction lands closest to the real channel by squared error. Eight
// evaluations of a handful of bins is cheap, and it answers the question
// that actually matters - which code's decode ends up closer to the source
// - rather than a proxy for it.

    // zero-bap bins are the whole input and payload.bap only holds the
    // winning offset's allocation from the evaluation just above; the flags
    // cost nothing in bits (dithflage is on regardless), so nothing about the
    // frame's size depends on this.
    //
    // Two streams are left out of the weighing, both because the decoder does
    // not dither them:
    //   * an AHT stream, whose zero-hebap bins reconstruct as literal zero
    //     whatever dithflag says (§E3.4's mantissas are read once for the
    //     whole frame, and there is no per-block substitution step);
    //   * every stream at all, when spectral extension is in use - see below.
    //
    // Spectral extension is the one place this encoder holds a reconstruction
    // of what the decoder will produce (the `rebuild` lambda in step 10),
    // because the extension bands are scaled to match the copy source's own
    // energy. Dither would change that source, and the encoder cannot
    // reproduce the values: DitherGenerator is deterministic per decoder
    // instance, but the sequence a given bin receives depends on how many
    // zero-bap bins the decoder walked before it, across every stream and
    // block. Mirroring that would mean duplicating the decoder's traversal
    // order in the encoder, which is exactly the kind of shadow model this
    // codebase has been bitten by before. Dither therefore stays off for a
    // frame that uses spectral extension, and the two models stay coherent by
    // construction.
