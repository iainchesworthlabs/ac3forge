// E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus) framing - ATSC A/52:2018 Annex E, bsid 16.
//
// E-AC-3 is not a variant of the AC-3 frame; it is a different container for
// the same coding tools:
//   - syncinfo is ONLY the sync word. There is no crc1, so the GF(2) leading
//     -CRC solver AC-3 needs has no counterpart here.
//   - frmsiz is an arbitrary 11-bit word count rather than a table lookup, so
//     any frame size is directly expressible and the 44.1 kHz padding
//     alternation AC-3 needs disappears.
//   - Exponent strategies and coupling-in-use for EVERY block are hoisted
//     into a frame-level audfrm element ahead of the blocks, and several
//     per-block fields become conditional on frame-level flags.
//
// This first step emits a valid, decodable bsid-16 frame carrying digital
// silence, the same way the AC-3 work started: all SNR offsets zero, which
// §7.2.2.1.1 defines as an all-zero bit allocation, so no mantissa data
// exists and the frame is pure syntax.

namespace ac3::eac3 {

// kBsid, StreamType and the Table E2.5 chanmap live in

// This encoder writes only strmtyp 0x0 and 0x1 - 0x2, an independent substream
// whose program was previously coded as AC-3, drags in a blkid/frmsizecod
// branch nothing here would ever emit, so validate() refuses it.

// Variable bit rate: instead of fixing the frame's word count and searching
// for the best quality that fits it (CBR's rate control, see FrameConfig's
// own comment below), fix the quality and let the word count follow the
// content. Only meaningful for E-AC-3: AC-3's frame size is a lookup into
// Table 5.18 (frmsizecod), not a free word count, so it has no equivalent.
