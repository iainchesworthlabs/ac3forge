// Joint Object Coding - ETSI TS 103 420 clause 6. The tool that gets more
// objects out of a decoder than there are channels in the bitstream.
//
// JOC codes no audio of its own. It carries a matrix: for each output object,
// how much of each downmix channel to take, per QMF parameter band and
// interpolated across the frame. The decoder (§6.6.6) computes
//     object[obj] = sum over channels of downmix[ch] * mix[obj][ch]
// in the complex QMF domain, so the "matrix" is really a set of per-band
// gains, and the whole tool is 5 channels in, up to 16 objects out.
//
// Because the reconstruction is a linear combination of the downmix, objects
// that were mixed into the SAME downmix channels with the same gains cannot be
// pulled apart again. JOC is a parametric approximation, not a lossless
// separation, and its quality depends entirely on how well-separated the
// objects were in the downmix.

// only domain in which a matrix this encoder estimates means the same thing
// on the other side.
//
// Domain::kMdctBand is the path that predates the filterbank: the same
// per-band linear combination applied in the 512-sample MDCT domain. It
// stays because it is cheaper and because a stream whose matrix was
// estimated in that domain reconstructs best there - but it is an
// approximation twice over. The MDCT is critically sampled and real, so its
// subbands only behave like subbands while neighbouring blocks agree on
// what was done to them; a per-band matrix that changes every frame breaks
// that time-domain alias cancellation and leaves the residue in the output.
// And its 256 bins map to §7.1's 64 subbands only four-to-one, so the
// matrix's time resolution is the 256-sample block rather than the QMF's

// and `object_history` is each object's own overlap-add tail. `previous_*`
// is what §6.6.5's ramp interpolates FROM; a shape mismatch against the
// frame just decoded (object count, band count) is treated exactly like
// FrameParameters::seq_count == 0 - no ramp, this frame's matrix applies to
// the whole frame outright - since there is nothing meaningful to ramp from.
//
// One state object serves either domain, and only the members that domain
// uses are ever touched; `qmf` in particular stays null until a kQmf call
// allocates it, so a decoder that never leaves the MDCT path carries none
