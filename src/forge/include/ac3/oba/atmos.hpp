// Dolby Atmos in Dolby Digital Plus: objects in, one ordinary-looking 5.1
// E-AC-3 stream out.
//
// The whole trick is that there is only one audio payload. Objects are panned
// into a 5.1 bed the way they always were, and that bed is what a legacy
// decoder plays - unchanged, at full level, complete. Alongside it ride two
// pieces of side data in an EMDF container: OAMD saying where each object is,
// and JOC saying how to pull the objects back out of the bed. A decoder that
// knows about neither is not merely tolerated, it is the design target.
//
// What JOC can and cannot do follows from that. The reconstruction is a linear
// combination of the five bed channels, so objects that landed on the same
// channels with the same gains cannot be separated again, however different
// they sounded going in. Elevation in particular costs nothing in the bed -
// the ring has no height speakers - so two objects at one azimuth and
// different heights are indistinguishable in the downmix, and the matrix can
// only split their shared energy in proportion to how loud each one is. That
// is not a defect of this encoder; it is what a parametric object coder is.
