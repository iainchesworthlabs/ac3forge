// conversion can comfortably afford: cost here is O(output_frames *
// kHalfWidth), paid once per loaded file rather than per audio-thread
// callback, so there is no reason to pinch it the way DriftResampler's live
// hot path has to. Wider buys a narrower transition band and deeper

// transition band room to roll off to the stopband BEFORE Nyquist instead
